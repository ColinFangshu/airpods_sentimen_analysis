       "      <td>I'm a professional OTR truck driver, and I bought a TND 700 at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier.  Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6\"), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn't gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.</td>\n",

I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.</td>\n",

This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen.

       "0  We got this GPS for my husband who is an (OTR) over the road trucker.  Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \"trucker\" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1  I'm a professional OTR truck driver, and I bought a TND 700 at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier.  Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6\"), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn't gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2  Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.   \n",
       "3  Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "4  I've had mine for a year and here's what we got. It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen. My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks.Wayne                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV.

       "      <td>The Nook Tablet, in both the 16gb version and 8 gb version, are the best color e-readers of 2012.  Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes &amp; Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a \"Brand X\" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as \"Automobile\" or \"National Geographic\".Barnes &amp; Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes &amp; Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines \"pop\" even more than their paper versions. Barnes &amp; Noble adds a special \"text only\" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook \"shop\" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get \"right\", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the \"book world\" and the \"video world\". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a \"book of the day\" for adults and a \"book of the day\" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was \"Mary Poppins\", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.</td>\n",

I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more \"manly\" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway. He also dowloaded Kingsoft Office and now uses this for work as well. Unbeatable hardware at an unbeatable price.... and don't let the restrictive stock software stop you from buying it... just go around it!!!</td>\n",

       "      <td>When B&amp;N; designed this one, they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&amp;N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap. Otherwise, it'd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more full-featured.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&amp;N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&amp;N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, \"Wow! it's as good as the Sony!\"  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes &amp; Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&amp;N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not \"locations\" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I bought this ebook (16G) for my Kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email. It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing. The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books. Apps for children are wonderful. My children love it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I pulled the trigger on three of these on pre-order back in November.  I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&amp;N;'s app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&amp;N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&amp;N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&amp;N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual \"we got your request and will reply as soon as possible\" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.We finally \"side loaded\" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to \"root\" products like these (especially since they aren't \"mine,\" as I won't be the one using them).  As the \"guy,\" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big \"n\" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&amp;N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&amp;N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the \"tablet\" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the \"expert\" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.</td>\n",

The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.much better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)supports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)battery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and dont scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.also if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhileCons:lack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either. That being said, this also means that apps available from BN will actually work with your Nook, there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either. This means that if you've bought an app from Android market, you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the Nook.The screen. trust me, I love it. But unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass, on the Nook if you crack it, the screen is toastno front facing camera (or any camera for that matter). The ability to use Skype would have been nice, but wasn't a complete necessity. I've had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once, and thinking about it, I wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that I will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on, like Starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth, which to me didn't matter, but it seems to be an issue for some people. There IS bluetooth, but it's disabled and there isn't a way to enable itno GPS, this would be nice, unlike bluetooth, I would actually use it.mono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?no .flac support. a good chunk of my digital music now is .flac. it does have .ogg support thoughno .avi support. again, a massive portion of my movies etc are all in .avi format. It does have .mkv and .mp4 support though, so from here on out I will just have to rip my video files in those formats if I plan on watching them on it.lack of decent accessories selection. lets face it, the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of Steve, and the availability of accessories shows it.</td>\n",

It works fine for what it is, but it caused her much confusion as it did not seem \"as nice\" to her as my 9in concerning screen quality.And that's because this is not the NEW Nook HD with a 1440X900 screen resolution and upgraded hardware, firmware, and software which has been on sale everywhere since the B&amp;N; Father's Day Sale was extended indefinitely. This is the OLD Nook color with a standard 1024X768 resolution screen and minus the upgraded hardware and OS.IOW this is the old model :)So if looking for that \"new, on sale\" tablet by B&amp;N; like my friend was, well, this ain't it. She will be returning hers and getting what she wanted initially.As for this one it looks fine and works fine for what it was, but comes up short these days, period.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I am a big fan of Apple's Bluetooth keyboard. I like its compact size, elegant design, and, almost more than anything else, the feel of its keys while typing. They provide the exact amount of tactile feedback that I like, and I almost don't like typing with any other keyboard. However, one of the shortcomings of this keyboard is the lack of separate numerical keypad that used to be the staple of most computer keyboards for as long as the personal computers have been around. Granted, I don't enter significant amount of numerical data any more, but every once in a while when I need to do some quick calculations I miss the actual separate numerical keypad. For the past year or so I had coopted the trackpad to do the job of a numerical keypad with the use of Mobee Technology Magic Numpad. However, this setup is far from ideal - I don't have the tactile feedback that I am so used to, and the surface of my trackpad has become decidedly less smooth and responsive. All of these shortcoming are the major reason why I am still interested in having an actual physical keypad, and this Satechi keypad seems to fit the bill.The Satechi keypad is very clearly designed to look like the Apple's keyboard and trackpad peripherals. However, unlike the Apple peripherals, it is not made out of aluminum but rather out of plastic. If you are just casually glancing at your work area desk you would not notice this difference though, but once you start typing the similarity disappears. The action of the keys is also softer than that of the Apple's keyboard.The setup was very straightforward. This is plug-and-play USB keypad, and plugging it into one of the available USB ports is all that's needed for it to be recognized by an Apple computer. The keypad is compatible with both the Mac computers as well as the Windows machines. It might also be compatible with some tablets and Linux computers, but I have not tested it with either one of those.This keypad is fairly rudimentary and I would have liked for it to include a few additional keys. They page navigation keys would have been nice, as well as a separate key for launching the calculator app on your computer. Even better would have been an inclusion of programmable keys. This would have made this keypad a very powerful tool in more sophisticated spreadsheet manipulations, advanced scientific calculations, or even as a gaming keypad.This is a really good product, and a welcome addition to my workspace. However, I think it's a bit on a pricey side. A price point that is $5 -$10 less than the current $20 on Amazon would make this keypad much more appealing to the general casual users. Furthermore, these days I am not too keen on wired peripherals, and much prefer to use the wireless ones whenever possible. Satechi makes another similar Bluetooth keypad as well and I would recommend that you check it out if you are more inclined towards wireless devices.**** Product sample provided for review purposes. ****</td>\n",

In the hand, it has a nice solid feel. The body is plastic, which keeps the weight light but strong. The finish is matte that enhances the grip while in the hand. Also, the AC prongs can be removed, which makes it perfect for traveling inside your luggage. On a side note, you can use a laptop adapter cord to plug it into the wall, thus giving you more working room.This charger plugs directly into the wall, which might be a hang up for some. I do not see this as problem since I am able to charge all my devices at the same time in one location. Before this charger, I would have to charge devices all over the house, now those dreadful memories are a thing of the past.Before use, be sure to read the back of the charger and see what port you need for the device you are needing to charge. You can charge up to four devices at the same time, but the maximum overall output will limited to 6.8A. This can be seen as a gift or curse, to me it is a gift. Being able to charge a diverse group of devices is a great thing.I use this single charger on my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, Galaxy Note 2, and Bluetooth headset and speaker all at the same time. Now all of my devices are all in one place being charged, which is much easier.This is a must have charger if you have multiple mobile devices!FEATURES:4 USB Output Ports: 5V/2A (2x), 5V/1A (2x), (Max Of 6.8A When All Ports Used)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</td>\n",

If you're like me, you'll have one of those huge ugly 4 gang plug sockets by the bedside, one for the smartphone charger, another for the iPad, yet another for the Kindle etc etc.This little device replaces all that. A single plug in charger, with 4 USB outputs - means you can charge up to 4 devices at one time from a single socket.It comes with a separate clip in US wall plug, or (if you already have one), you can plug in a figure of eight lead into the charger. Just clip in the plug adapter, plug it into the wall and off you go.Build quality appears good, and there's a blue light to indicate power. It comes with 4 USB sockets, with two each of 1.0 amp and 2.4 amp. Basically, you should charge a smartphone or kindle on the 1.0 amp sockets, and larger tablet computers on the 2.4 amp. It will take longer to charge from the lower power sockets, but it's safer for devices which need a lower power input.In conclusion, at this price, it's a great alternative to having four separate charge plugs, and small enough to pack for a holiday with the entire family.Disclosure: I was provided this by the manufacturer for an independent review, although it's a pleasure to review good quality items.Highly Recommended.</td>\n",

       "      <td>With more and more devices these days requiring USB charger capabilities, it was inevitable that we'd start seeing chargers with more and more ports. With roughly a dozen USB devices of one kind or another, I need all the ports I can get. Two of the ports are higher-powered ports, suitable for Apple products and tablets of various kinds; the other two are lower-power, suitable for Android phones, Bluetooth headphones, and the like. Unlike some chargers, this has the power to charge on all ports simultaneously, although you will need to supply your own USB cables and Apple adapters.The charger is quite compact, about the same size as a similar two-port charger I've been using. One potential drawback is that there is no power cord: the device must plug directly into the wall. That's not uncommon and there is an easy workaround, to use an extension cord, but I figured I should note it.When I read a description like, &amp;#34;Removeable Plug Portable Travel Charger,&amp;#34; I expect to be able to swap the plug out with a plug more suitable to the locale to which I'm traveling. According to the manufacturer's website, you can get a version of this product with either a US, EU, or UK plug. But if there's a way to get any of the plugs by themselves, I was not able to locate it, either via a web search or the manufacturer's website. If you want all of the plugs, it looks like you have to purchase three separate chargers. I was able to locate the charger with the UK plug on the amazon.co.uk site. I wasn't able to locate the charger with the EU plug.I'm knocking off a star for that latter issue but otherwise I'm very pleased with this. I really like being able to charge so many devices at once and I like the convenient size. It does exactly what it claims and it does it very well. And at $12.99 at the time I write this review, it's very competitively priced. I have no hesitation in recommending it.Disclaimer: the manufacturer provided a sample for review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome. I have no personal or financial interest in the company or in anyone employed there.</td>\n",

I was not able to check out what their max output is.I used this after a long weekend using my phone and had 3 external batteries to charge. I charged the two largest batteries on the 2.4Amp ports and the smaller battery and my phone on the 1amp port. by morning My phone was charged and later that evening the other three batteries had charged. So compaired to the charge time with other 2 amp chargers I would say that this is a true 2.4 amp charger.I agree with the other reviewer that there is a note about other plugs being available but there are no other instructions on how to get them.I will be going on a business trip in the next few weeks and will need to charge multiple phones, a tablet, and External battery packs, this charger is going to be coming with me!Overall this is a must have charger to charge all gadgets!</td>\n",

This charger helps me ensure that I have a steady supply ready for each performance.While this charger will not simultaneously charge all of the batteries the KC-110 needs, it makes charging them in groups of four fast, sure and safe. The LED indicator is more convenient than you can imagine because I tend to multi-task and sometimes lose track of things. The older charger I was using had red and green lights, but no way for me to tell if I had at least sufficiently charged batteries I could grab if I were strapped for time. This one tells me just how charged up each battery is (in thirty-three percent increments).What I especially love and why I rated this five solid stars is the refresh feature. This charger will drain down a battery and recharge it, which actually prolongs the battery life. If you read the description and wondered what 'memory effect' is, that is the tendency of a battery to cause false readings. Some batteries will be at 100 percent, but display a different number (or display fully charged, but not be). The activation function on this charger will correct that.I tested all of the above features and they work as described. While the world may seem to be moving towards batteries that power phones, tablets and just about everything else, the AA and AAA rechargeable are still very much in use and it you are using them, this is definitely the charger to get.</td>\n",

Once the work is done, flip the screen all the way back and browse the interweb with a flick of the finger.  It really is the best of both worlds.In the styling departiment it is just decent.  Besides the flip screen there are no innovative features.  The weight is just slightly heavier then I'd would like, but it won't kill your hand if you are using it as a tablet.  Their 'windows' button on the screen is kind of annoying cause it is right where I'd put my hand.  The silver finish seems to be prone to scratching, just a few weeks has produced several small scratches just sitting on my desk.  The hinge system seems robust so that will be good in the long run.  The rubber feet on the bottom are leaving marks on the back of the screen when flipped into tablet mode.For being a small laptop, it is still easy to type on.There does seem to be some software build issues straight out the box.  After the initial large burst of updates the laptop was running very slow.  Eventually it cleared, but I have noticed other instances of slow down.  It seems to have mostly cleared up after 3 weeks.The touchscreen works great.  It has great accuracy even around the edges.  I've used other tablets that seem to not be able to read touches around the edges, which is really annoying when you are trying to close a program.  It is pretty responsive but no where near as quick as an iPad.  To be fair, I haven't seen any Windows tablets match the speed and accuracy of an iPad.The mouse touchpad is another weak point.  It is at times too sensitive and then at other times not responsive.  I also had some instances where using the touchscreen and then using the touchpad somehow 'broke' the touchpad functionality.  I was not able to click or scroll using the touchpad, only could move the cursor.  Rebooting fixed the problem.Overall it is a good little laptop, I wouldn't use it for AAA games, but for doing a little work and a little play it packs a big punch.Side note, check out the Lenovo Yoga for a strong contender in this market.</td>\n",

It's strong &amp; light and works in a number of different ways... Laptop style, flat, back bend for video playback, or as a tablet. In case you were wondering, yes the keyboard is exposed on the back when in the tablet configuration, but the keys are disabled once the screen is flipped around, plus they're recessed so they aren't really in the way. The battery life has been very good I've gotten at least 6 hours of life if not more. The Windows 8.1 OS is reasonable for tablet use and the touchscreen works well with it. And while it doesn't come across as zippy, It loads fast enough that I don't get video lag or ever feel like I'm waiting on it either. It does seem to run faster when plugged in. So if you're doing anything intensive, it's not a bad idea to plug in.The only cons I can think of are the lack of dedicated F keys (they're shared with the number row), and I've had one small hiccup with the trackpad in Chrome (fixed with a reboot). Other than that it hasn't locked up or acted unexpectedly.Overall, if money is tight any you need the laptop for work/school but would like to occasionally flip it back and just consume content then this is a great deal.</td>\n",

I am so pleased to say that I have had zero issues with this one so this processor and setup must do the trick.  It works like a dream! BTW, this is an Intel Pentium N3530 2.16 Ghz.  At the bottom of the page w/comparable specs, it shows an Intel Celeron.I haven't really had a huge desire for a tablet because I just thought I prefer the laptop style and I figured this would just be cumbersome, but I was wrong about this too.  This is a very small laptop but a large tablet and it is so easily mobile.  It's very lightweight and just flipping it all the way open and folding the keyboard back is so simple.  It makes it so portable and you just pull up the virtual keyboard on the screen and all works perfectly.  The screen adjusts to whether you are holding vertically or horizontally just as it does on a tablet.The display, sound and webcam are fantastic too.  I've had issues with sound recently on laptops so I'm so glad I hear well on this one.  With such a small laptop I wasn't sure but it works great and the screen resolution is pristine.  The whole computer feels quality even though lightweight.  When I pulled it out of the box and it was so compact and light I was a bit hesitant and unsure.  Give it just a little time. Once you get used to it I think you will be so pleasantly surprised.Finally, I will admit I've owned a few Dell laptops over the years and was less than impressed. However, I got a Dell desktop a few months back and it is fantastic and have had no issues with it.  And just since I've had this one, I like it more and more the longer I have it. So, I think they may have turned a corner on any issues they've had.  I know I have with any that I've had with them.  Great, quality products and enthusiastically recommend this computer, especially if you have to tote a laptop around frequently but don't want an open tablet as I didn't.UPDATE: I've had this computer for several weeks and have still had no error messages or high usage warnings.  I noticed that there was a 3 star review on here that said it is basic and the trackpad isn't responsive.  I want to say that my trackpad is very responsive. Because this is such a small laptop it may take some getting used to - pad itself is large.  Also, for this price point and with these specs, this computer performs amazingly well. I can watch movies or livestream while performing other tasks and have no problems at all.  No, it's not for heavy gamers, but I think most of them would not search for these specs and dimensions. I find myself taking this from room to room all throughout the day because it's so portable. Still enthusiastically 5 stars for me!I've had a couple of questions about the keyboard...it is pretty small because it is a small computer and, thus, a little harder to type on.  I definitely find it easier to type on the larger keyboards and miss that.  However, I would lose the easy portability if they made it any larger and I wouldn't want that.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My house has suffered from a break-in in the past, and since then, I've been looking for various ways to protect my home.  One such measure was to get a wireless security camera.  The Belkin NetCam is actually the second cam I've owned, but it's probably the better of the two.One of the biggest positives was how easy it was to set the NetCam up.  Activation is completely wireless (unlike my previous camera, a Foscam) and the included quick start guide made for a fast, easy installation that took less than 10 minutes.  The camera's set up is done via an iOS or Android app, which, while barebones, is easy to use and understand.Speaking of the app, I use the iOS app on my phone, and it works great.  I can view live video, turn the microphone on/off, and activate the speaker.  The other camera I had used a web-based interface, which wasn't as easy to use, though, admittedly, it did allow for more detailed control.  I prefer the smartphone/tablet app route, as it makes monitoring my camera much easier.Another positive for me is picture quality.  My previous camera's resolution was 640x480.  This camera's output is 1280x720.  Plus, it has a wide angle lens, so it can capture more of an area (as compared to my old security cam).  This camera also features infrared lights, giving the NetCam night vision.And my final reason for liking the NetCam so much is its compact size.  It's much less conspicuous sitting on my shelf compared to my other camera, which was easily twice as large.As for cons, the Foscam I had had pan and tilt, which means I could remotely control where the camera is aimed.  The Belkin NetCam doesn't feature that.  It's on a swivel arm and once you set it, that's it.  As a security cam or baby monitor, that's usually not a big deal, though, so I'm fine with that.I also don't care for how frequently the camera emails me photos because it detected &amp;#34;motion.&amp;#34;  I don't know what it's picking up on, but I get dozens of email a day, with ZERO real activity.  I can easily foresee a &amp;#34;boy who cried wolf&amp;#34; scenario, where a real problem could go unnoticed until it's too late, because the owner thinks it's just another bogus email.  To be fair, my Foscam suffered from the same problem.That, coupled with the fact that the camera seems late in snapping security photos may render this useless for many.  In my use, the camera is sitting on a shelf facing my front door.  If I set motion detect sensitivity to low, it reduces the number of false alarms, but it either completely misses REAL activity (my entering or leaving) or has blurred or mis-timed photo (my back as I close the door).  If I set it to high, I get a lot more false positives (tons of emails) and it still is hit-and-miss (though it does give me more useable photos).  In this regard, the Foscam was better.  I still suffered from tons of emails, but I had more usable photos.Overall, I'm still happy with this camera and will use it to replace my Foscam.  It fits better in the location I have it, I prefer the field of view the lens gives, and the app makes it much easier to use.  I'd recommend it more as a baby monitor or live feed camera, as opposed to strictly as a security camera, but it does an OK job in that regard, too.  A soft four (maybe 3.5) stars.</td>\n",

(Can I add static routes and ACLs for each console and program that expects UPnP to be there? Sure. Do I want to? No.)Out of the box, I was underwhelmed. I don't know what kind of gear people are using that makes the build quality seem &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; here, but Netgear's own switches are built way better than this router and at a tenth (yes, 1/10) of the price. I flipped out each antenna, plugged it in, and got to configuring...The initial configuration from my Windows 8 system wanted to poop router and NAS applications on my system. I took a look at the router app, and ended up firing up a browser. The admin page that came up was indistinguishable fromNetgear's N900 router, which I thought was a major disappointment. This is squarely marketed as an enthusiast's router, so I was expecting at least as much functionality as you'd get out of DD-WRT on a throwaway router. Not so with the R8000. The router quickly called home and asked for a firmware update (V1.0.0.74_1.0.31)Once I had it configured, I started moving wireless clients over. About halfway through, I noticed that a couple of devices saw two 5GHz SSID's instead of one. Later testing would show that the router wasn't forcing slow devices to flop over to their own network. If the device could see two SSIDs with the same name, they'd associate with whatever you chose on the device, instead of the router being &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; and choosing what network to allow association with.Strike one.Later in the evening, I noticed my Macbook Pro stopped passing WAN traffic, but didn't have any trouble hitting LAN traffic. Rebooting the router resolved the problem. And rebooting the router resolved the problem again after four hours. And again...Strike two.My ultra-fast router *should* be pretty impressive when it comes to LAN traffic, right? I mean, my months-old MacBook Pro *should* be able to connect to the network with the fastest throughput, and it *should* be pretty fast to my NAS device, connected to the router via GigE. Well, not so much. The throughput I'm seeing is in the neighborhood of 70 megabits. Even at 30% overhead, I should be seeing almost ten times the throughput I'm getting.Strike three.I noticed that Netgear has recently released V1.0.0.90_1.0.39 firmware, which seems to have addressed the &amp;#34;the WAN just stops working&amp;#34; problem, but has made LAN throughput even worse.Sorry, Netgear. That just won't do. For what this costs, I can buy three routers and run three separate wireless networks for less money, with improved throughput, and improved range.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Well, more like a 4.5.  I wanted a router with a bit longer 5ghz range as I had a D6200 in back of my AT&amp;T; uverse, and the 5ghz signal was iffy in my room like 35ft away from the router.  This R8000 seem to be the latest with all the bells and whistles.  They touted long range with 6 antennas.  The -.5 is for the antennas.  For 299 retail you'd expect a little more quality.  You pull the antennas up and they feel like they're just gonna break off, very flexy flimsy feeling, but no problems once they're in place.  Not sure if they are helping or not yet, haven't had time to adjust them, they will stay put at 45 degrees and 90.  The router itself has like a whole line of leds on top which I don't know what they all are for, but it's bright.  You can thankfully turn them off in the setup.  The setup is identical to any other netgear router, so it was easy.  You can keep the 2 - 5ghz signals separate with 2 different ssid's, or combine them which I did using one ssid.  I didn't see much difference either way as the netgear seemed to divide up the online devices between the two, so I just let netgear do it instead of me having to put in a new ssid for half my devices.  So setup, I was up in less then 30 minutes, since I had a netgear already.  I updated the firmware and seems pretty stable.  Well for the 2 days I had it so far, it's been rock steady.  All my devices are at the same IP's so I know it hasn't rebooted as one of my devices is on an access point with dhcp built in and that always changes when the router reboots.  So far it's been pretty good.  All my devices have the 5 wireless bars and connections excellent throughout my smaller house.  I was only getting 2 bars in my bedroom with the D6200, so it's a little better then 2x the D6200.  I haven't tested my tablet outside, but that will be the next test.  I will post any negatives I find as I work with this, but so far it's a straight forward design and tried and true setup interface that's pretty easy to setup.  If you have an RG3800 and need info on how,  post a msg, i'll try to explain it.  Oh and I was connecting at low 200's Mbps with an AC1200 adapter,  but now it's always 650Mbps and above in my room,  any closer and it always connects at the AC1200 speed which is 867Mbps.  And the rest you can get from specs online, basically on/off button, usb 2 and 3,  4 Ethernet gigabit ports, 1 wan.Update: So far had it about a week and it's been working great.  I have my security cams forwarded with upnp on with no problems now.  Everything is working as it should.  I was a linksys fan, but this is working great for me.  Oh and it does have guest access too, but i have mine all turned off, two SSID's is plenty enough.  will put a network hard drive on next, will report if i have any difficulties.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I recently purchased the NETGEAR Nighthawk R8000 X6 router as an upgrade to my old Linksys E3000 router that I have had for almost 4 years.  Needless to say this router is a huge and much needed improvement.  I noticed that on all of my computers, tablets, and smart phones that the internet pages load faster.  Apps that use a lot of bandwidth such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Flixster all load faster and adjust to HD quality streaming way faster than with my old router.  I also noticed that performance remains outstanding even when we are using three demanding apps at the same time (wife and I watching Netflix and Amazon Prime, and the kids watching Netflix on the TV.I have to admit that I was very hesitant to purchase this router after reading a lot of negative reviews of the router's performance, especially with the 5Ghz channels.  I am here to tell you now that with the latest firmware update, these problems are gone.  The first thing I did when I installed the router was update the firmware immediately.  From the first minute I started using the router I have had zero issues.  There have been no problems connecting to the router with my PC (Windows 8.1 Pro), any of my tablets (Apple iPad 4, Amazon Kindle HDX, Samsung Galaxy Tab S), or our smart phones (Samsung Galaxy S5 &amp; Note 3).So without further ado, here are my lists of Pros and Cons:PROs1) Simultaneous Tri-band Wi-Fi works as advertised - no issues with network load when multiple users are online2) Excellent wireless range - the beam forming technology really works well and ensures the strongest signal by adjusting the frequency management accordingly with the surrounding environment3) Build quality of the router is second to none, though it is a bit larger than previous routers that I've owned4) The NETGEAR website is easy to navigate and both software manual and latest firmware are easy to find under the Support section5) The NETGEAR technical support team has surprised a lot of customers by aggressively addressing the early release technical issues this router had and have successfully fixed most if not all of the problems.CONs1) Price is high at $300, but there is currently no competition for this class of WiFi router...yet...Asus will be releasing their next-gen routers soon, so expect NETGEAR to drop the price on the X6 a bit to remain competitive with Asus!2) Does not support next-generation MU-MIMO technology.  There are rumors that NETGEAR may release a firmware update that will allow for MU-MIMO like capability, but don't hold your breath.  This router does not have the necessary hardware to officially support MU-MIMO technology (i.e. Qualcomm QCA 9980 and QCA 9982).Bottom line, if you want an excellent upgrade to your aging 802.11g or 802.11n router, now is the time to jump in and get this awesome router.  You will not be disappointed...unless that is if you have a thin wallet or really 'need' MU-MIMO  :-D</td>\n",

Select that, and it connects right away.

It can get quite loud, and it&amp;#8217;s clear and strong. It&amp;#8217;s not high fidelity, and won&amp;#8217;t please audiophiles. I detect a little bit of noise, but it&amp;#8217;s only barely noticeable. The bass is pretty good, but I think it sounds better with mid range and high notes. Still, it&amp;#8217;s much better and much bigger than you&amp;#8217;d get from the phone alone.It&amp;#8217;d be a great speaker for camping or any outdoor activities &amp;#8212; especially those where you&amp;#8217;d be worried about splashing and inclement weather. Ideal for the poolside or the beach or for hiking where it might rain. (It isn&amp;#8217;t water proof. There&amp;#8217;s a cover for the USB and 3.5mm audio inputs, but it wouldn&amp;#8217;t protect them if you immersed it in the water.

But a hub it is.Dimensions of the body are about 3 7/8 inches long by slightly over a half inch thick. It takes up very little space for road warriors and travelers, and if you are using a micro OTG connector for your phone or tablet like this one -Micro USB OTG Host Cable to USB 2.0 Adapter- this hib is the perfect way to expand it.I was concerned that this would not really support four devices simultaneously so I plugged it into my ThinkPad T61 running Windows XP. I populated the four ports with a mouse, a keyboard, my digital camera and my Galaxy Note 3 phone. I was especially eager to see if the phone balked because it's finicky about what gets plugged into it when it comes to synching and transferring. No problem with any of the devices (in fact I am writing this review using the external keyboard). I was able to read the camera's memory card with Windows Explorer while transferring a dummy file from my phone.  I did not test any of the claimed transfer speeds.Bottom line: this is small, convenient and works on my old laptop without a hitch. It may be only USB 2.0, but it's plenty fast for my needs. Especially since the only 3.0 device I own is my phone and I rarely connect it to anything but my 2.0 laptop. For what it is I rated it five stars.</td>\n",

I tested the speed of a thumb drive with and without the hub and found that it did not slow down transfers.

That took up all 3 of my USB ports and left no room for my external portable USB speaker. And my Surface Pro only has one USB port! That's why I was delighted to have the opportunity to review this slim, bar-style USB hub.I was surprised to see just how slim and lightweight this hub is! That's a big plus when traveling with my Surface Pro because this will fit into my small carrying case. It plugs into a USB port and gives you three additional ports for a total of 4 ports from one. It doesn't need an external power supply and there are no drivers to install because it's plug and play. The drivers are installed the first time you plug it in.I plugged in 4 different USB devices and all ports worked perfectly however, I did get a message on my Kindle screen that it was plugged into a low power port and therefor wouldn't charge while in use and would charge slowly when not in use. Because the power from one USB port is divided into 4 ports, you should assume that it won't charge any device very quickly, but the devices can be used while plugged into this hub.Although this is USB 2.0 rather than the faster USB 3.0, it will still work in a USB 3.0 port - just not at USB 3.0 speeds.NOTE: Anyone with a computer will find this to be very handy and even though I was provided a sample of this hub for reviewing purposes, I liked it so much I just ordered 3 more for other family members.</td>\n",

This means that more of your devices are able to play audio to a pair of wired speakers that can now become wireless with the simply addition of this little gadget by Sabrent.This means you can use your smartphone, tablet, Windows, and Mac computer mainly because the audio that is played to the little gadget is via AirPlay. Sabrent has even taken note that Apple has this pre-configured in their iDevices (i.e. iPod touch, iPhone, and iPad) as well as making sure that Android users has this benefit, too. On the other hand, Windows users are out of luck but that's a whole different story.Due to the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver playing music via the connection of Wi-Fi I have noticed that the signal was a lot stronger than Bluetooth. My Internet speed is pretty fast and the connection is solid no matter if I used a smartphone or a tablet.Where Does the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Lack?AirPlay is known for playing multimedia from iOS devices and since the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver depends on this it kind of kick some people in the butt. Basically, those users, like myself, that own a Windows Phone won't have the luxury to use this little gadget like those that own an iDevice or/and Android device. I will continue to search for apps that use AirPlay for Windows Phone until then this isn't a recommended product for Windows Phone users.Besides the lacking support for Windows Phone users I also see a BIG difference from their main competitor, CoolStream, which is that there's no built-in battery. The Duo Bluetooth Receiver from CoolStream offers a built-in 8-hour battery while the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver requires you to plug it into a USB port (i.e. Computer, Wall Outlet, etc.).How the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Fit in my Life?Personally, I don't see myself using this gadget mainly because the lack of support for Windows Phone as well as being required to plug it into a USB port just to power it. I do have the option to bring a portable battery charger but that's a bit much and I don't see myself having a big interest with it.I believe that this gadget fits better for a user that have a pair of speakers that are not in use but are near an outlet or/and computer and want them to use them again with the help of the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver. Basically, they will be able to control the audio in their home from anywhere inside and outside of their house.Why Should You Purchase this for Yourself?Do I recommend it? Well, yes and no; those that own an iOS and Android device should consider picking one up for themselves very soon but those that own a Windows Phone should wait until support is given either from Sabrent or an app in the Windows Store.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This audio receiver provides a novel approach to wireless audio transmission, using WiFi rather than bluetooth. This item plugs in to any USB outlet for its power source. Once plugged in it can be linked to a wireless audio transmission source such as an iPad/iPhone or Android phone/tablet.  For this connection to be made you need to go into your phone/tablet WiFi settings and choose the Sabrent device from the available WiFi connections that appear. Then, you can use DLNA or Airplay supporting apps to play the audio and the audio should stream wirelessly to the receiver, which will play the sound through a headphone or speaker that you connect to the 3.5 mm output jack on the Sabrent receiver. When I tested this following the included instructions it worked smoothly. The sound quality is very good, better than bluetooth since the WiFi doesn't compress the audio. The drawback is that you can't have your device connected to any Internet WiFi source while it's connecting to the WiFi audio receiver. This item is also limited by the USB only power and the short length of the USB cable that folds in to the receiver. This could be used in your home as well as in a car where the vehicle has a 3.5mm auxiliary audio input jack and a USB plugin. This is a nice alternative to have available for wireless audio transmission from select devices. This receiver has red and blue LED indicator lights to show the presence of the WiFi connection and the audio transmission. Perhaps in the future this will be upgraded to offer more options, such as supporting other devices and offering a bluetooth connection for streaming audio from a webstream. It currently comes with a 1 year warranty and tech support in case you have trouble setting it up. I received a free item from the manufacturer for review purposes.</td>\n",

       "      <td>TheSabrent Wifi Audio Receiverhas allowed me the ability to add wireless audio streaming to an older sound system that would never have imagined Wi-Fi existence in its time.  I used this system with a 3.5mm to RCA adapter cable to accomplish my goal and it has worked brilliantly.  One thing to keep in mind, you will need to keep this unit powered via a USB port, but for me that is simple enough.Setup to your sound output system is as easy as connecting the cable, connecting your device to the Sabrent will follow similar setup to that of connecting a device to a wireless network.  After plugging in the system and letting it boot up, on your Wi-Fi enabled device (phone, tablet, etc) search for the Sabrent_A1AE network and connect.  After successful connection, you can now play music wirelessly to your sound system.  I'm considering getting a second unit for the car because of how smart this setup is.  What makes this unit `better' than Bluetooth receivers is that Wi-Fi can offer better quality sound transfer and has a greater range than the max of 30ft you can get from a typical Bluetooth receiver.Overall, a solid performer and offers a unique solution to improve upon the myriad of Bluetooth receivers on the market today.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</td>\n",

Having no prior experience with BT speakers before now, I had relatively low expectations despite the glowing reviews.As one of the few reviewers who has actually purchased the speaker and thus has a bit of skin in the game, I can say that I am wholly pleased with this bluetooth speaker.  The overall performance and fidelity is exceptional and exceeds my expectations.While it won't be replacing my floor standing wired speakers, I can see where a pair of these set up in stereo format would create a very pleasing system suitable for many uses.Though I purchased the unit primarily for porch and deck duty, it sounds great in the kitchen and library as well.Thus far I've enjoyed music from disparate artists such as Charles Mingus, Donald Fagen, Simply Red, Lyle Lovett and Red Garland among others. They all sound great.None of my devices feature NFC but thus far I have had no difficulty mating the \"Roar\" with an iPhone, iPad, Kindle HDX and a Chromebook.I won't use many of the features provided on the \"Roar\" but for pure music enjoyment alone it is worth the asking price, imho.Highly recommended from a reasonably critical and picky listener.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Update 14 July 2014: they have a white paper at creative.com/roar/whitepaper.pdfI have no doubt this is where I will put my money. 5 stars! ROAR!!!It is pointless to write another thumbs up review like what the overwhelming majority have done.Thus, for those who would like to look at its cons and how the cons may affect some, here they are:1) No audio volume indicator. It will be good to have some form of LED or even display.2) Too many features can confuse or up the learning curve. Some people just want the features simple, just do it.3) MicroSD Card support is only up to 32GB. If you have higher capacity, it may not work. My tiny 1GB card works.4) MicroSD Card needs to be formatted to FAT/FAT32. If you by chance have a NTFS one, it may not work.5) MicroSD Card playback lacks controls. You can play, pause, skip to next song, skip to next folder (by pressing and hold the forward button), random/continous play and that's all.You cannot fast foward play a song and so on. And yes, the buttons at the back are for controlling the card playback, not bluetooth. And you cannot use Bluetooth to control the card playback.Since the buttons are at the back, you could accidentally press back when you wanted to press forward.6) MicroSD Card playback does not support gapless. I know Windows Media Player since day 1 has support for it, same for a certain fruit company's products. My LG phone cannot play gapless too. If you need lossless audio, I am only in luck with wav. My WMA lossless does not work. My mp3 or wma 320kbps works.7) MicroSD Card playback is based on date/time the file is copied. FIFO. You cannot create a playlist. If you think you want to get this as a full featured jukebox, you might be disappointed. If you don't understand what is FIFO just use bluetooth.8) Bluetooth range is ok, but not always satisfying your expectations. My experience is the range is less than my wireless keyboard/mouse. If you are in an area full of bluetooth and wifi signals, good luck. If you keep on thinking about why the price is half of the competitor and why it is made in China, you may start losing confidence.9) If you looking at voice recording at 16bit 48kHz, you may want to ask Creative tech support how it could be done.10) Microphone to answer phone call is really ok, just ok only. A tad soft. If you have Soundblaster Axx 200, you will know what is the benchmark.11) To optimally and efficiently charge the roar, you will need to use the supplied AC charger, not any generic 5V 1A.12) Micro USB port is not very strong, just like Nexus 7 (2012). Take care if you plug in and out using USB cable daily.13) The device is a little heavy compared to speakers like Soundblaster Axx 200. If you are neither strong nor careful, let me know the drop test result. I have yet to.14) It is a rectangular box like device that occupies a large footprint compared to speakers like Soundblaster Axx 200. If you prefer a tiny footprint, do not get the Roar. To achieve optimal audio results, you may have to try positioning it near a wall, at a corner of the room and so on.15) Since it can connect to the desktop/laptop, you might think it can allow you to enjoy SBX effects on your favorite cans. There is no audio jack out. For gamers, there is no scout mode. Finally, changing SBX effects is not available through Android/iOS app.16) If you connect it to AC power and up the volume, you may find it louder than without AC power.17) If you find it too bassy, you might want to send it back for a refund. I have 2 suggestions. If you just want good mids/highs, small footprint/lighter/more features, better mic, get Soundblaster Axx 200. If you want to set it to neutral, connect to desktop/laptop, download SBX software (SoundBlaster Control Panel) and tune it.18) If you think it can outperform your 5.1 system/expensive soundbar, you will find its lack of stereo separation a regret. Solution is buy another Roar with the mega stereo cable to link up for wider soundstage. Note that the mega stereo cable is not an ordinary jack. It is slightly modified.19) The 6000mAh battery is non-removable, not user replaceable unless you are prepared to do soldering. My old Nokia feature phone battery is still working fine. Try to avoid draining the battery to zero too often, this can help to lengthen battery lifespan.20) The 5V 1A output can hardly charge large tablets. If you think of buying this just as a powerbank, think twice. After struggling to fully charge my LG Optimus Pro G (3140mah), it can hardly roar. Meow it goes.21) Battery life is ok, just plain ok. Nowhere near Soundblaster Axx 200. When battery life is low, it cannot output loud enough. You may want to buy a huge capacity powerbank for this.22) It is mainly dark gray in color. No other colors available including the accessories.23) Like any bluetooth device, you may have a device that is not willing to pair with it or you like to hear sudden pause in your music/audio.24) Like my Soundblaster Axx 200, you may have a certain laptop/desktop that somehow refuse to interact well with the Roar even after reinstall, reset, change micro USB cable and so on. Oh yes, older USB cables may not work well.25) It is not waterproof. The large horizontal top increases the probability of water invading the drivers.26) My Efergy power monitoring socket finds it consume more power during charging than Soundblaster Axx 200. 2 amplifiers means more power needed. To be fair, it still consumes less power than most 2.1 systems.27) No built-in FM tuner. So many features and yet this is missing. It was the standard in all Creative mp3 players (once upon a time...).20) No frequency response given. Doesn't matter. Certain frequencies are inaudible to humans. Give me a frequency response curve with SNR, that's better. You have a new fan and wants to know its rpm. I prefer to personally experience the wind (coverage, distance, timer, remote control) and noise from it during a hot afternoon.29) Creative is trying to make a comeback. Well, compared to some other brand that can sell very well even with twice this price, this brand still has some way to go. In fact, the Roar that you are getting today is like Roar 1.1 (some features added recently). I will not rule out a Roar 2 coming within a year that functions as a full jukebox too.I will update once I encounter new flaws.Last updated on 11 Jul 2014 :)</td>\n",

       "      <td>The names Creative Labs and Sound Blaster are legendary among computer enthusiasts because they brought sound and especially music to computers. Early personal computers had no sound other than what was provided by a quarter-sized speaker only capable of making strange beeps and clicks people associated with old computers.The Sound Blaster quickly became the standard for adding high quality sound to the PC, first with an internal card and later using the USB connection. Sound Blaster is still THE name in PC audio cards with their high-end X-Fi Titanium product that they say can create three dimensional (3D) sound so accurate that gamers can locate their opponents by sound before they can even be seen.And now there is the Creative Sound Blaster Roar SR20A which redefines the simple Bluetooth speaker with five drivers including a built-in subwoofer. Power well beyond its modest size, the quality sound that sends music pumping out in seemingly every direction, filling surprisingly large areas with screaming highs and thumping bass, the speaker also has a number of well-executed, unexpected capabilities.I first heard about this speaker when a friend returned from the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Vegas last January. He said there was always a large crowd gathered around the Creative Labs booth where the new Roar was being demonstrated. He was impressed by what he saw and heard, but even after his slightly embarrassing gushing, I had no idea of all of the speaker's functions. After finally having one in my hands, and here is the list of everything it can do.Wireless speakerI use the Bluetooth 3.0 connection to play tunes from my iPod, tablet and laptop. The Bluetooth is seriously enhanced on the Roar, with 3 different Link Security (LS) modes controlled by a switch on the back,: connect two devices at once (LS mode 2, the default) and play one at a time, restrict to previously pared devices only (LS mode 1), or allow any device to grab control from the current device (LS OFF mode).It also supports near field communication (NFC) so you can connect by tapping the music player on the Roar. For conventional Bluetooth pairing, press the large tactile silicon button closest to the middle of the top of the unit (the multi-function button) and hold until the normally yellow light turns white and begins to blink. A voice says \"Pairing mode, waiting for a device to connect.\"The other buttons on the top are plus and minus to control volume, the Roar button, and the power button. The Bluetooth is very powerful, connecting instantly to my iPod from 15 feet away and staying connected even when I took the iPod into another room. Bluetooth modes supported are: A2DP (Wireless Stereo Bluetooth), AVRCP (Bluetooth Remote Control), and HFP (Hands Free Profile) for phone use - see below.Hands-free phoneWhen the phone rings while connected to the speaker using Bluetooth, pressing the multi-function button will answer the call, with the caller's voice clearly heard on the speaker. The Roar's built-in microphone is sensitive enough to conduct a phone conversation while several feet away. Pressing the record button during the call will create an audio file copy of the call in the Voice folder of the MicroSD card. Holding the multi-function button down for two seconds or more when the phone rings, causes the call to be ignored.Electric guitar practice amplifierPlug the guitar into the AUX IN port and play through the Roar. I have only been able to do this before with other speakers by first connecting the guitar to another device (the iRig from IK Multimedia) and then to an iPod, and then to the speaker. Plugging directly into the Roar I can be playing in seconds without worrying about the daisy chain of devices hanging out of my guitar. The sound was excellent and plenty loud to work as a practice amp at home or on the road.Portable file storageConnected the Roar to a PC through the USB connection, and copied files to the MicroSD card inserted in the Roar. MicroSD class 4 and above cards are supported with capacities up to 32 gigabytes (GB) when formatted as FAT16/32 drives.Portable music playerUsing the MicroSD card created above, the Roar is a portable music player, using the controls on the back to skip forward or backward, play the WMA, WAV, and MP3 music song files randomly, or repeating them depending on the switch setting.Battery ChargerI charged my iPod and phone to full strength using the built-in 6,000 mAh (milliamp hours) battery through the DC OUT USB connection on the back of the Roar. One of the three battery strength lights on the Roar went out after the charging was complete, indicating that about 30% of the battery power had been used.Sleep or stay-awake aidPlayed music all day, switching between Bluetooth and MicroSD, then went to sleep with the Roar gradually reducing the volume and turning itself off. I also tried the stay awake feature that plays loud voices to startle you awake, which was annoying, but effective.Alarm SirenSwitching the alarm switch from Off to Arm and pressing the Alarm button starts a loud undulating siren. Not quite as loud as a true home alarm siren, it is still plenty ear-splitting. Slide the switch back to off to stop it. If you got lost in the forest, this would help rescuers find you quickly.Computer Audio SystemConnected the Roar with USB to a Windows PC with no speakers or audio drivers, and loaded the SoundBlaster control panel software from the website. The SoundBlaster control panel includes the SBX Pro Studio which enables the creation of sound templates that can be loaded on the Roar to tailor the sound to different sources and environments.There are 9 pre-made templates that will probably suit most needs without creating new templates. Templates are loaded to the Roar by clicking or touching them, it is as simple as that. My favorite for both music and video viewing is the Stadium Surround that uses special effects to trick your ears into hearing spacious surround sound that I find really enhances the experience.The other 8 provided templates are SBX Default, Warm Sound, Smart Volume, Dynamic Boost, Night Sound, Clear Dialog, Clear Comms, and Cinematic Action. Without the Roar, sometimes it is difficult, even with the volume cranked all the way up, to hear dialog and music from videos playing on my laptop. With it, there is enough headroom to blow the roof off.Sound EnhancementsPressing the Roar button acts as a loudness enhancer when maximum power is desired, such as in noisy environments. Using this feature seemed to significantly boost the bass and vocal range of the speaker. The manufacturer also recommends plugging in the power adapter which also provides extra volume compared to battery mode operation.There is also a \"Tera Bass\" mode that, if desired, boosts the bass levels at lower volumes. It is activated by pressing the Alarm button on the back of the unit while the music is playing. While the bass did seem slightly over emphasized using this feature, I liked it, though that is purely subjective, dependent upon the user and type of music being played.AccessoriesA Mega Stereo Cable is available, allowing two Roar speakers to be used together, with the Master left speaker controlling the right speaker as a slave. And, a mesh carrying case permits the speaker to be easily transported and the mesh panels permit it to be played without removing the case or muffling the sound.The Roar has joined my cell phone, iPod, and PC as essential technical devices used throughout the day. The quality, seemingly endless features and reasonable price make this device beyond impressive. Opportunities are continually presenting themselves to put it to use to improve the experience of whatever activity is occupying my time. There is no going back.Review unit provided by Creative without obligation.</td>\n",

       "2       This adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box. I had not problem with it at all, it is well worth the purchase. I recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your Nook videos on your HDTV. I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor, I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV. For me it was just right not too long or too short, I was able to place my Nook right below the connection on the TV stand, it did not fall or anything else, it is fine. Use your own judgement, I'm too busy watching my movies :)

       "3       This adapter easily connects my Nook HD 7&#34; to my HDTV through the HDMI cable.  This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port.  It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen. A bit pricey, but a good accessory to have.  Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series.  It will not work with a standard Nook.

       "4       This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.- The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place.- On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid.- It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV. Nice they made such a device.

       "6       This is a good beefy 2 amp charger, but it covers two outlets on a power strip. It's ok in a regular wall outlet. The best thing is it uses a standard USB connector so it can charge more than just a Nook (I have a Kindle Fire HD+).

       "7       It does 2A and charges a DEAD Nook in a few hours. It does so with a LOT of heat, compared to most wall worts. I have a dual charger where 1 port is 2.1A and the other is 1A for total output of 3.1A that doesn't run as hot as this. And i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hubIt does the job adequately as it's designed to. Just hot. I would always unplug it if not using (even though it cools off) because of the amount of heat made. The nook hd+ runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait, but not so much when charging. I guess it's better to have it at the plug.

       "8       The Nook Tablet, in both the 16gb version and 8 gb version, are the best color e-readers of 2012.  Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a \"Brand X\" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as \"Automobile\" or \"National Geographic\".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines \"pop\" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special \"text only\" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook \"shop\" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get \"right\", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the \"book world\" and the \"video world\". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a \"book of the day\" for adults and a \"book of the day\" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was \"Mary Poppins\", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "9       I saw this product on Amazon and thought \"what a great deal\" because this is a 16GB version of the same tablet that Barnes & Noble is selling for $250 dollars.It mostly works, and the screen is great for reading books.  I have had problems with the browser since 2 weeks of owning and the Apps have issues loading and playing some games.  If I could, I would return this product and just pay out the money for a brand new one.

       "10      this is excellent tablet, excellent touch screen response and button controls. When you hold it in your hand, you will feel that its built tough and can withstand rough handling(my 17m old tosses it sometimes out of excitement and its still holding good). Battery is also good, last about 8+ hours; the old drawback is that there are very limited apps on Noon web, but I heard there's a way to sideload adds from Amazon that I haven't tried yet. But yes, I would highly recommend it.

       "12      Have no idea why people love this thing so much, you can't load any applications unless they are from the Barnes & Noble store and you can't even download the free version of Angry Birds.Apparently Barnes & Noble is worse than Apple at remotely disabling Nooks they deemed rooted by end users. You have less control of this thing than you would your TV.The root kits are useless for this OS version 1.4.2 and the instructions to root / jailbreak it read worse than rocket instructions from annoying geeks !It is an overpriced Barnes & Noble franchise in your dumb little hands and you're well served keeping your receipt and refunding it.

       "13      I bought this for my husband for his birthday after trying it out in BN and seeing how amazingly responsive it is. I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more \"manly\" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway. He also dowloaded Kingsoft Office and now uses this for work as well. Unbeatable hardware at an unbeatable price.... and don't let the restrictive stock software stop you from buying it... just go around it!!!

       "14      When B&N; designed this one, they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap. Otherwise, it'd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more full-featured.

       "15      this is such a great tablet. one time didn't work. acted weird really weird. needed to be cleaned. now I keep eyeglass cleaning clothes (disposable) for it. has worked like a charm since. hooks up to the computer without the shelves going away. book reading is great too. I use it for an ereader with games that I sometimes play, but mostly as an ereader. recommended.

       "17      Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, \"Wow! it's as good as the Sony!\"  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not \"locations\" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.                                                                                                        \n",
       "18      You would be crazy to buy here... its cheaper anywhere else.  UPDATE  I see amazon is now selling at the same price as the rest of the world so I retract...Also discovered another negative... When browsing the web the nook works fine on all sites EXCEPT AMAZON, now fancy that.  It will stay on amazon about 30 seconds then pop back to where ever I was before web browsing.  I've tried it over and over does it every time.Thanks to all who commented about the ability to still root the nook.  it is more complicated now but doable.  I'm debating about giving it a try.  Updated 1/22/12There are things to like about the nook, BUTNo android marketB&N; wants your credit card to download FREE apps -  ain't gonna happenstuff that is free on Android Market cost money at the B&N; app store.  I.E. Angry Birds costs 2.99 but is free from Android Market.I bought this Nook because it was root-able... but no longer with the latest update B&N; blocks attempt to root the device.BOO HISS ON B&N.;I never buy anything Apple because of the closed system.  I totally believe in Open architecture for electronic devices.  The closed system ONLY benefits the seller not the user.If all you want is a reader, email and the web.  then hey go for it.  but I truly disappointed and may return it.

       "19      I bought this ebook (16G) for my Kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email. It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing. The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books. Apps for children are wonderful. My children love it.

       "20      I pulled the trigger on three of these on pre-order back in November.  I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N;'s app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual \"we got your request and will reply as soon as possible\" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.We finally \"side loaded\" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to \"root\" products like these (especially since they aren't \"mine,\" as I won't be the one using them).  As the \"guy,\" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big \"n\" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the \"tablet\" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the \"expert\" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "21      I went to a few places just to try testing them out, best place to test them out first hand was BN. The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.much better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)supports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)battery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and dont scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.also if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhileCons:lack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either. That being said, this also means that apps available from BN will actually work with your Nook, there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either. This means that if you've bought an app from Android market, you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the Nook.The screen. trust me, I love it. But unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass, on the Nook if you crack it, the screen is toastno front facing camera (or any camera for that matter). The ability to use Skype would have been nice, but wasn't a complete necessity. I've had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once, and thinking about it, I wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that I will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on, like Starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth, which to me didn't matter, but it seems to be an issue for some people. There IS bluetooth, but it's disabled and there isn't a way to enable itno GPS, this would be nice, unlike bluetooth, I would actually use it.mono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?no .flac support. a good chunk of my digital music now is .flac. it does have .ogg support thoughno .avi support. again, a massive portion of my movies etc are all in .avi format. It does have .mkv and .mp4 support though, so from here on out I will just have to rip my video files in those formats if I plan on watching them on it.lack of decent accessories selection. lets face it, the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of Steve, and the availability of accessories shows it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "22      And what is it? Why it's an outdated B&N; Tablet! A friend of mine purchased this after seeing my 9in HD+ tablet, but wanted the smaller 7in version. It works fine for what it is, but it caused her much confusion as it did not seem \"as nice\" to her as my 9in concerning screen quality.And that's because this is not the NEW Nook HD with a 1440X900 screen resolution and upgraded hardware, firmware, and software which has been on sale everywhere since the B&N; Father's Day Sale was extended indefinitely. This is the OLD Nook color with a standard 1024X768 resolution screen and minus the upgraded hardware and OS.IOW this is the old model :)So if looking for that \"new, on sale\" tablet by B&N; like my friend was, well, this ain't it. She will be returning hers and getting what she wanted initially.As for this one it looks fine and works fine for what it was, but comes up short these days, period.

       "24      I read all the reviews and decided to buy this Barnes and Noble Nook for my Grandson for Christmas it was used but with original box and accesories  through EZ CORPS!!!  And I'm happy to say this Barnes and Noble is the best I ever invested in the picture and color is beautiful. Let's put it this way my niece that has the kindle was checking out the Barnes and Noble nook and compared it to her kindle said that the Barnes and Noble Nook has a clear picture than her kindle and more apps!!! And I told her I did my homework and looked this Nook up and it had the best reputation as far as for a kid,Young teen, Best nook ever invested in money and used at that but I will only order used if the item says like New with original Box with Accesories . And  I will only order anything used through EZ CORPS!! Best company to ever order anything from on Amazon fast professional customer service and love there shipping and handling !! And there all there used products are tested before selling which is a plus. I would Highly recommend this company any day to any one , Friends,Family,etc,Yes this Barnes & Noble Nook is well worth ordering used or new.

       "25      I could not be more pleased with - or impressed by - the Nook Tablet! I know that Amazon is \"enemy territory\", but the NT does a much better job of meeting my needs than would a Kindle Fire.Not only can I use my NetFlix account but I also have full access to the Amazon Prime website to watch films and videos!The screen is incredible - bright and colorful and very fast due to both the fast processor and the full Gig of RAM. I popped-in a 16G micro SDHC card and have more than enough room for my entire library of sideloaded epubs, pdfs, mp3s, and mp4 videos.And, of course, the primary use: It's now much easier to read in bed at night. The backlit screen means no more glare from an external reading light.

       "26      I have tried the IPad, the Kindle, and the Sony, and nothing has worked better than this Nook Tablet. It's light, the screen resolution is amazing for movies, and the applications I use work beautifully. Even the speakers are excellent for what they are. No complaints at all.

       "27      Nice specs with nice screen. Not worth the price with just the stock operating system, might as well save the bucks and buy the cheaper color model. You cannot use the larger 16gb internal memory to load your own files as the bad boys at B&N; restricts your access to only 1gb of that memory. UPDATE: Because of the unhappy owners B&N; will relax this restriction when you take the unit into their store and reserved space will be changed so you get 8gb free space.As is, the unit is SEVERELY crippled from making full use of its outstanding specs. Turn this baby into a great Android tablet by \"rooting\" it - easily and painlessly done by buying one of those SD card based kits. I got a 32 GB card with the root kit and I now have full access to Android apps with the ability to revert back to stock is if desired. You can now get all these capabilities on a really good performing tablet for well under $130 (like new used) but remember you get a unit that's a generation old and doesn't have bluetooth, gps, and hdmi out like most other newer tablets have.

       "28      If all you want is a tablet for reading B&N; books and periodicals and maybe playing the occasional cheesy game, this is for you.  Otherwise, pass.This is listed as an Android tablet but it's not.  It's Android on the surface but it can't access Google Play and instead uses the B&N; app store.  This means paying for apps that are free elsewhere.Also, my unit takes an incredibly slow 2 minutes to boot, drops wireless signals that are strong and includes a browser that has the speed of a 90s drug store computer.Wonder where the camera is?  It's at the factory -- there isn't one.  Forget Skype or face to face video chatting.Spend your $200 on a real tablet.By the way, not a slap at Amazon, just the tablet itself.

I got both on this Tablet.The product arrived two weeks ago, I did charge the battery and afterwards registreded the product so I immediately starting getting books, nowadays I have plenty of Nook Books to read ahead.My co-workers and friends love the aesthetics of the Nook look, as I love all the features in the device.Pros: All of them.- The screen is so clear (\"Wows!\" me all the time), fast response to tasks, easy menu, fast processor, Micro SD card slot added 32GB extra fun (big smile), lightweight, long life battery. etc.Cons: None

       "100919  I am a big fan of Apple's Bluetooth keyboard. I like its compact size, elegant design, and, almost more than anything else, the feel of its keys while typing. They provide the exact amount of tactile feedback that I like, and I almost don't like typing with any other keyboard. However, one of the shortcomings of this keyboard is the lack of separate numerical keypad that used to be the staple of most computer keyboards for as long as the personal computers have been around. Granted, I don't enter significant amount of numerical data any more, but every once in a while when I need to do some quick calculations I miss the actual separate numerical keypad. For the past year or so I had coopted the trackpad to do the job of a numerical keypad with the use of Mobee Technology Magic Numpad. However, this setup is far from ideal - I don't have the tactile feedback that I am so used to, and the surface of my trackpad has become decidedly less smooth and responsive. All of these shortcoming are the major reason why I am still interested in having an actual physical keypad, and this Satechi keypad seems to fit the bill.The Satechi keypad is very clearly designed to look like the Apple's keyboard and trackpad peripherals. However, unlike the Apple peripherals, it is not made out of aluminum but rather out of plastic. If you are just casually glancing at your work area desk you would not notice this difference though, but once you start typing the similarity disappears. The action of the keys is also softer than that of the Apple's keyboard.The setup was very straightforward. This is plug-and-play USB keypad, and plugging it into one of the available USB ports is all that's needed for it to be recognized by an Apple computer. The keypad is compatible with both the Mac computers as well as the Windows machines. It might also be compatible with some tablets and Linux computers, but I have not tested it with either one of those.This keypad is fairly rudimentary and I would have liked for it to include a few additional keys. They page navigation keys would have been nice, as well as a separate key for launching the calculator app on your computer. Even better would have been an inclusion of programmable keys. This would have made this keypad a very powerful tool in more sophisticated spreadsheet manipulations, advanced scientific calculations, or even as a gaming keypad.This is a really good product, and a welcome addition to my workspace. However, I think it's a bit on a pricey side. A price point that is $5 -$10 less than the current $20 on Amazon would make this keypad much more appealing to the general casual users. Furthermore, these days I am not too keen on wired peripherals, and much prefer to use the wireless ones whenever possible. Satechi makes another similar Bluetooth keypad as well and I would recommend that you check it out if you are more inclined towards wireless devices.**** Product sample provided for review purposes.

       "100920  This USB wall charger has four USB ports on the front. Two of them are 2.4 Amp high powered ports for charging power hungry devices like an iPad or many of the larger tablets. Then it has two lower powered 1 Amp USB ports for charging devices like a cell phone or smaller tablets like a kindle. Some wall chargers advertise four ports but fail to inform you that you can't charge on all four ports at the same time without sacrificing speed. That is not the case with this wall charger because it has enough power to charge on on all four USB ports at  the same time and at full speed.The design it simple but looks nice. There is a LED light at the bottom that confirms that it's powered up. It comes with the standard US power adapter. This USB wall charger is reliable and a good choice if you want a simple and well made charger but don't need any bells and whistles.Sample provided for review.

       "100921  This is wall charger will charge all devices at once, need I say more!There are four USB ports that are used for charging an array of devices from tablets to Bluetooth headsets or whatever else needs a charge. In the hand, it has a nice solid feel. The body is plastic, which keeps the weight light but strong. The finish is matte that enhances the grip while in the hand. Also, the AC prongs can be removed, which makes it perfect for traveling inside your luggage. On a side note, you can use a laptop adapter cord to plug it into the wall, thus giving you more working room.This charger plugs directly into the wall, which might be a hang up for some. I do not see this as problem since I am able to charge all my devices at the same time in one location. Before this charger, I would have to charge devices all over the house, now those dreadful memories are a thing of the past.Before use, be sure to read the back of the charger and see what port you need for the device you are needing to charge. You can charge up to four devices at the same time, but the maximum overall output will limited to 6.8A. This can be seen as a gift or curse, to me it is a gift. Being able to charge a diverse group of devices is a great thing.I use this single charger on my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, Galaxy Note 2, and Bluetooth headset and speaker all at the same time. Now all of my devices are all in one place being charged, which is much easier.This is a must have charger if you have multiple mobile devices!FEATURES:4 USB Output Ports: 5V/2A (2x), 5V/1A (2x), (Max Of 6.8A When All Ports Used)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.

       "100922  I have to admit, at first I couldn't quite see why I'd want yet another wall charger, however, I now get it. If you're like me, you'll have one of those huge ugly 4 gang plug sockets by the bedside, one for the smartphone charger, another for the iPad, yet another for the Kindle etc etc.This little device replaces all that. A single plug in charger, with 4 USB outputs - means you can charge up to 4 devices at one time from a single socket.It comes with a separate clip in US wall plug, or (if you already have one), you can plug in a figure of eight lead into the charger. Just clip in the plug adapter, plug it into the wall and off you go.Build quality appears good, and there's a blue light to indicate power. It comes with 4 USB sockets, with two each of 1.0 amp and 2.4 amp. Basically, you should charge a smartphone or kindle on the 1.0 amp sockets, and larger tablet computers on the 2.4 amp. It will take longer to charge from the lower power sockets, but it's safer for devices which need a lower power input.In conclusion, at this price, it's a great alternative to having four separate charge plugs, and small enough to pack for a holiday with the entire family.Disclosure: I was provided this by the manufacturer for an independent review, although it's a pleasure to review good

       "100923  With more and more devices these days requiring USB charger capabilities, it was inevitable that we'd start seeing chargers with more and more ports. With roughly a dozen USB devices of one kind or another, I need all the ports I can get. Two of the ports are higher-powered ports, suitable for Apple products and tablets of various kinds; the other two are lower-power, suitable for Android phones, Bluetooth headphones, and the like. Unlike some chargers, this has the power to charge on all ports simultaneously, although you will need to supply your own USB cables and Apple adapters.The charger is quite compact, about the same size as a similar two-port charger I've been using. One potential drawback is that there is no power cord: the device must plug directly into the wall. That's not uncommon and there is an easy workaround, to use an extension cord, but I figured I should note it.When I read a description like, &#34;Removeable Plug Portable Travel Charger,&#34; I expect to be able to swap the plug out with a plug more suitable to the locale to which I'm traveling. According to the manufacturer's website, you can get a version of this product with either a US, EU, or UK plug. But if there's a way to get any of the plugs by themselves, I was not able to locate it, either via a web search or the manufacturer's website. If you want all of the plugs, it looks like you have to purchase three separate chargers. I was able to locate the charger with the UK plug on the amazon.co.uk site. I wasn't able to locate the charger with the EU plug.I'm knocking off a star for that latter issue but otherwise I'm very pleased with this. I really like being able to charge so many devices at once and I like the convenient size. It does exactly what it claims and it does it very well. And at $12.99 at the time I write this review, it's very competitively priced. I have no hesitation in recommending it.Disclaimer: the manufacturer provided a sample for review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome.

       "100924  Opening up the sample package there was the US outlet adapter and the charger itself. Clearly marked on the charger are the 4 ports two of them are rated at 1 amp, and two are rated at 2.4 amp. I was not able to check out what their max output is.I used this after a long weekend using my phone and had 3 external batteries to charge. I charged the two largest batteries on the 2.4Amp ports and the smaller battery and my phone on the 1amp port. by morning My phone was charged and later that evening the other three batteries had charged. So compaired to the charge time with other 2 amp chargers I would say that this is a true 2.4 amp charger.I agree with the other reviewer that there is a note about other plugs being available but there are no other instructions on how to get them.I will be going on a business trip in the next few weeks and will need to charge multiple phones, a tablet, and External battery packs, this charger is going to be coming with me!Overall this is a must have charger to charge all gadgets!

       "100925  This USB Power Adapter does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it well. This can eliminate multiple chargers for your tablets, smart phones, power banks, Bluetooth devices, etc. by giving you 4 outlets in one with the full charging power from a wall outlet. This will generally charge much faster than a USB port on your PC or Laptop (and if you are like me most of your USB ports are taken). I've had no problems with this adapter and it works great.

       "100926  When I was offered a review sample of this charger I jumped at the chance because I go through batteries like crazy (even rechargeable ones.)I own aRoland KC-110 3-Channel 30-Watt Stereo Mixing Keyboard Amplifierthat is battery powered and I need spares since I perform with it. This charger helps me ensure that I have a steady supply ready for each performance.While this charger will not simultaneously charge all of the batteries the KC-110 needs, it makes charging them in groups of four fast, sure and safe. The LED indicator is more convenient than you can imagine because I tend to multi-task and sometimes lose track of things. The older charger I was using had red and green lights, but no way for me to tell if I had at least sufficiently charged batteries I could grab if I were strapped for time. This one tells me just how charged up each battery is (in thirty-three percent increments).What I especially love and why I rated this five solid stars is the refresh feature. This charger will drain down a battery and recharge it, which actually prolongs the battery life. If you read the description and wondered what 'memory effect' is, that is the tendency of a battery to cause false readings. Some batteries will be at 100 percent, but display a different number (or display fully charged, but not be). The activation function on this charger will correct that.I tested all of the above features and they work as described. While the world may seem to be moving towards batteries that power phones, tablets and just about everything else, the AA and AAA rechargeable are still very much in use and it you are using them, this is definitely the charger to get.

       "100927  The overall functionality of this laptop is great.  Being able to flip it open and start typing like a normal laptop is very productive.  Once the work is done, flip the screen all the way back and browse the interweb with a flick of the finger.  It really is the best of both worlds.In the styling departiment it is just decent.  Besides the flip screen there are no innovative features.  The weight is just slightly heavier then I'd would like, but it won't kill your hand if you are using it as a tablet.  Their 'windows' button on the screen is kind of annoying cause it is right where I'd put my hand.  The silver finish seems to be prone to scratching, just a few weeks has produced several small scratches just sitting on my desk.  The hinge system seems robust so that will be good in the long run.  The rubber feet on the bottom are leaving marks on the back of the screen when flipped into tablet mode.For being a small laptop, it is still easy to type on.There does seem to be some software build issues straight out the box.  After the initial large burst of updates the laptop was running very slow.  Eventually it cleared, but I have noticed other instances of slow down.  It seems to have mostly cleared up after 3 weeks.The touchscreen works great.  It has great accuracy even around the edges.  I've used other tablets that seem to not be able to read touches around the edges, which is really annoying when you are trying to close a program.  It is pretty responsive but no where near as quick as an iPad.  To be fair, I haven't seen any Windows tablets match the speed and accuracy of an iPad.The mouse touchpad is another weak point.  It is at times too sensitive and then at other times not responsive.  I also had some instances where using the touchscreen and then using the touchpad somehow 'broke' the touchpad functionality.  I was not able to click or scroll using the touchpad, only could move the cursor.  Rebooting fixed the problem.Overall it is a good little laptop, I wouldn't use it for AAA games, but for doing a little work and a little play it packs a big punch.Side note, check out the Lenovo Yoga for a strong contender in this market.

I just ignore it and nothing bad seems to happen, but who knows

       "100929  If you want a fast tablet experience, then get a tablet.If you want a fast light weight laptop with a real OS, then buy an ultrabook.If you'd like both but only have enough money for a tablet... then this is an EXCELLENT compromise.The build quality excellent. It's strong & light and works in a number of different ways... Laptop style, flat, back bend for video playback, or as a tablet. In case you were wondering, yes the keyboard is exposed on the back when in the tablet configuration, but the keys are disabled once the screen is flipped around, plus they're recessed so they aren't really in the way. The battery life has been very good I've gotten at least 6 hours of life if not more. The Windows 8.1 OS is reasonable for tablet use and the touchscreen works well with it. And while it doesn't come across as zippy, It loads fast enough that I don't get video lag or ever feel like I'm waiting on it either. It does seem to run faster when plugged in. So if you're doing anything intensive, it's not a bad idea to plug in.The only cons I can think of are the lack of dedicated F keys (they're shared with the number row), and I've had one small hiccup with the trackpad in Chrome (fixed with a reboot). Other than that it hasn't locked up or acted unexpectedly.Overall, if money is tight any you need the laptop for work/school but would like to occasionally flip it back and just consume content then this is a great deal.

       "100930  The Dell Inspiron i3147-3750sLV 11.6 inch 2 in 1 Convertible Touchscreen Laptop hybrid is a decent choice for basic computing needs. It incorporates the versatility of a laptop with the ease of use and convenience of a tablet. The best feature is the touch screen which is very responsive, but the track pad sometimes lags and is not as responsive. The screen is very clear, with vibrant colors and good off angle viewing. The construction of the hybrid good and solid. It does not feel cheap, even considering it's low cost. This product would be best used for web browsing, office applications, and light gaming.

       "100931  I wasn't sure what to expect with this because I have another laptop with similar specs but a different Intel processor and different brand and it seems to give me those high usage warnings frequently, especially when multi-tasking and/or watching videos and movies.  I am so pleased to say that I have had zero issues with this one so this processor and setup must do the trick.  It works like a dream! BTW, this is an Intel Pentium N3530 2.16 Ghz.  At the bottom of the page w/comparable specs, it shows an Intel Celeron.I haven't really had a huge desire for a tablet because I just thought I prefer the laptop style and I figured this would just be cumbersome, but I was wrong about this too.  This is a very small laptop but a large tablet and it is so easily mobile.  It's very lightweight and just flipping it all the way open and folding the keyboard back is so simple.  It makes it so portable and you just pull up the virtual keyboard on the screen and all works perfectly.  The screen adjusts to whether you are holding vertically or horizontally just as it does on a tablet.The display, sound and webcam are fantastic too.  I've had issues with sound recently on laptops so I'm so glad I hear well on this one.  With such a small laptop I wasn't sure but it works great and the screen resolution is pristine.  The whole computer feels quality even though lightweight.  When I pulled it out of the box and it was so compact and light I was a bit hesitant and unsure.  Give it just a little time. Once you get used to it I think you will be so pleasantly surprised.Finally, I will admit I've owned a few Dell laptops over the years and was less than impressed. However, I got a Dell desktop a few months back and it is fantastic and have had no issues with it.  And just since I've had this one, I like it more and more the longer I have it. So, I think they may have turned a corner on any issues they've had.  I know I have with any that I've had with them.  Great, quality products and enthusiastically recommend this computer, especially if you have to tote a laptop around frequently but don't want an open tablet as I didn't.UPDATE: I've had this computer for several weeks and have still had no error messages or high usage warnings.  I noticed that there was a 3 star review on here that said it is basic and the trackpad isn't responsive.  I want to say that my trackpad is very responsive. Because this is such a small laptop it may take some getting used to - pad itself is large.  Also, for this price point and with these specs, this computer performs amazingly well. I can watch movies or livestream while performing other tasks and have no problems at all.  No, it's not for heavy gamers, but I think most of them would not search for these specs and dimensions. I find myself taking this from room to room all throughout the day because it's so portable. Still enthusiastically 5 stars for me!I've had a couple of questions about the keyboard...it is pretty small because it is a small computer and, thus, a little harder to type on.  I definitely find it easier to type on the larger keyboards and miss that.  However, I would lose the easy portability if they made it any larger and I wouldn't want that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "100932  My house has suffered from a break-in in the past, and since then, I've been looking for various ways to protect my home.  One such measure was to get a wireless security camera.  The Belkin NetCam is actually the second cam I've owned, but it's probably the better of the two.One of the biggest positives was how easy it was to set the NetCam up.  Activation is completely wireless (unlike my previous camera, a Foscam) and the included quick start guide made for a fast, easy installation that took less than 10 minutes.  The camera's set up is done via an iOS or Android app, which, while barebones, is easy to use and understand.Speaking of the app, I use the iOS app on my phone, and it works great.  I can view live video, turn the microphone on/off, and activate the speaker.  The other camera I had used a web-based interface, which wasn't as easy to use, though, admittedly, it did allow for more detailed control.  I prefer the smartphone/tablet app route, as it makes monitoring my camera much easier.Another positive for me is picture quality.  My previous camera's resolution was 640x480.  This camera's output is 1280x720.  Plus, it has a wide angle lens, so it can capture more of an area (as compared to my old security cam).  This camera also features infrared lights, giving the NetCam night vision.And my final reason for liking the NetCam so much is its compact size.  It's much less conspicuous sitting on my shelf compared to my other camera, which was easily twice as large.As for cons, the Foscam I had had pan and tilt, which means I could remotely control where the camera is aimed.  The Belkin NetCam doesn't feature that.  It's on a swivel arm and once you set it, that's it.  As a security cam or baby monitor, that's usually not a big deal, though, so I'm fine with that.I also don't care for how frequently the camera emails me photos because it detected &#34;motion.&#34;  I don't know what it's picking up on, but I get dozens of email a day, with ZERO real activity.  I can easily foresee a &#34;boy who cried wolf&#34; scenario, where a real problem could go unnoticed until it's too late, because the owner thinks it's just another bogus email.  To be fair, my Foscam suffered from the same problem.That, coupled with the fact that the camera seems late in snapping security photos may render this useless for many.  In my use, the camera is sitting on a shelf facing my front door.  If I set motion detect sensitivity to low, it reduces the number of false alarms, but it either completely misses REAL activity (my entering or leaving) or has blurred or mis-timed photo (my back as I close the door).  If I set it to high, I get a lot more false positives (tons of emails) and it still is hit-and-miss (though it does give me more useable photos).  In this regard, the Foscam was better.  I still suffered from tons of emails, but I had more usable photos.Overall, I'm still happy with this camera and will use it to replace my Foscam.  It fits better in the location I have it, I prefer the field of view the lens gives, and the app makes it much easier to use.  I'd recommend it more as a baby monitor or live feed camera, as opposed to strictly as a security camera, but it does an OK job in that regard, too.  A soft four (maybe 3.5) stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "100933  I have a pretty diverse network -- a couple of MacBook Pros, a Lenovo W520, an HP 8550, a couple of home-built systems, iOS tablets, Android tablets, an old Roku, a new Roku, printers, cell phones, VoIP phones, NAS, and Blu-Ray players. Some are wired. Some are wireless. I'm sure I'm missing other things there.Having been a network engineer well before the 802.11b spec was anything anyone cared about, I was really excited to see Netgear was building a multi-core router that could handle my devices *and* be smart enough to create a &#34;slow lane&#34;. I had been giving some lower-end Cisco gear some consideration, but for my consoles, UPnP was a deal breaker. (Can I add static routes and ACLs for each console and program that expects UPnP to be there? Sure. Do I want to? No.)Out of the box, I was underwhelmed. I don't know what kind of gear people are using that makes the build quality seem &#34;premium&#34; here, but Netgear's own switches are built way better than this router and at a tenth (yes, 1/10) of the price. I flipped out each antenna, plugged it in, and got to configuring...The initial configuration from my Windows 8 system wanted to poop router and NAS applications on my system. I took a look at the router app, and ended up firing up a browser. The admin page that came up was indistinguishable fromNetgear's N900 router, which I thought was a major disappointment. This is squarely marketed as an enthusiast's router, so I was expecting at least as much functionality as you'd get out of DD-WRT on a throwaway router. Not so with the R8000. The router quickly called home and asked for a firmware update (V1.0.0.74_1.0.31)Once I had it configured, I started moving wireless clients over. About halfway through, I noticed that a couple of devices saw two 5GHz SSID's instead of one. Later testing would show that the router wasn't forcing slow devices to flop over to their own network. If the device could see two SSIDs with the same name, they'd associate with whatever you chose on the device, instead of the router being &#34;smart&#34; and choosing what network to allow association with.Strike one.Later in the evening, I noticed my Macbook Pro stopped passing WAN traffic, but didn't have any trouble hitting LAN traffic. Rebooting the router resolved the problem. And rebooting the router resolved the problem again after four hours. And again...Strike two.My ultra-fast router *should* be pretty impressive when it comes to LAN traffic, right? I mean, my months-old MacBook Pro *should* be able to connect to the network with the fastest throughput, and it *should* be pretty fast to my NAS device, connected to the router via GigE. Well, not so much. The throughput I'm seeing is in the neighborhood of 70 megabits. Even at 30% overhead, I should be seeing almost ten times the throughput I'm getting.Strike three.I noticed that Netgear has recently released V1.0.0.90_1.0.39 firmware, which seems to have addressed the &#34;the WAN just stops working&#34; problem, but has made LAN throughput even worse.Sorry, Netgear. That just won't do. For what this costs, I can buy three routers and run three separate wireless networks for less money, with improved throughput, and improved range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "100934  Well, more like a 4.5.  I wanted a router with a bit longer 5ghz range as I had a D6200 in back of my AT&T; uverse, and the 5ghz signal was iffy in my room like 35ft away from the router.  This R8000 seem to be the latest with all the bells and whistles.  They touted long range with 6 antennas.  The -.5 is for the antennas.  For 299 retail you'd expect a little more quality.  You pull the antennas up and they feel like they're just gonna break off, very flexy flimsy feeling, but no problems once they're in place.  Not sure if they are helping or not yet, haven't had time to adjust them, they will stay put at 45 degrees and 90.  The router itself has like a whole line of leds on top which I don't know what they all are for, but it's bright.  You can thankfully turn them off in the setup.  The setup is identical to any other netgear router, so it was easy.  You can keep the 2 - 5ghz signals separate with 2 different ssid's, or combine them which I did using one ssid.  I didn't see much difference either way as the netgear seemed to divide up the online devices between the two, so I just let netgear do it instead of me having to put in a new ssid for half my devices.  So setup, I was up in less then 30 minutes, since I had a netgear already.  I updated the firmware and seems pretty stable.  Well for the 2 days I had it so far, it's been rock steady.  All my devices are at the same IP's so I know it hasn't rebooted as one of my devices is on an access point with dhcp built in and that always changes when the router reboots.  So far it's been pretty good.  All my devices have the 5 wireless bars and connections excellent throughout my smaller house.  I was only getting 2 bars in my bedroom with the D6200, so it's a little better then 2x the D6200.  I haven't tested my tablet outside, but that will be the next test.  I will post any negatives I find as I work with this, but so far it's a straight forward design and tried and true setup interface that's pretty easy to setup.  If you have an RG3800 and need info on how,  post a msg, i'll try to explain it.  Oh and I was connecting at low 200's Mbps with an AC1200 adapter,  but now it's always 650Mbps and above in my room,  any closer and it always connects at the AC1200 speed which is 867Mbps.  And the rest you can get from specs online, basically on/off button, usb 2 and 3,  4 Ethernet gigabit ports, 1 wan.Update: So far had it about a week and it's been working great.  I have my security cams forwarded with upnp on with no problems now.  Everything is working as it should.  I was a linksys fan, but this is working great for me.  Oh and it does have guest access too, but i have mine all turned off, two SSID's is plenty enough.  will put a network hard drive on next, will report if i have any difficulties.

       "100935  I recently purchased the NETGEAR Nighthawk R8000 X6 router as an upgrade to my old Linksys E3000 router that I have had for almost 4 years.  Needless to say this router is a huge and much needed improvement.  I noticed that on all of my computers, tablets, and smart phones that the internet pages load faster.  Apps that use a lot of bandwidth such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Flixster all load faster and adjust to HD quality streaming way faster than with my old router.  I also noticed that performance remains outstanding even when we are using three demanding apps at the same time (wife and I watching Netflix and Amazon Prime, and the kids watching Netflix on the TV.I have to admit that I was very hesitant to purchase this router after reading a lot of negative reviews of the router's performance, especially with the 5Ghz channels.  I am here to tell you now that with the latest firmware update, these problems are gone.  The first thing I did when I installed the router was update the firmware immediately.  From the first minute I started using the router I have had zero issues.  There have been no problems connecting to the router with my PC (Windows 8.1 Pro), any of my tablets (Apple iPad 4, Amazon Kindle HDX, Samsung Galaxy Tab S), or our smart phones (Samsung Galaxy S5 & Note 3).So without further ado, here are my lists of Pros and Cons:PROs1) Simultaneous Tri-band Wi-Fi works as advertised - no issues with network load when multiple users are online2) Excellent wireless range - the beam forming technology really works well and ensures the strongest signal by adjusting the frequency management accordingly with the surrounding environment3) Build quality of the router is second to none, though it is a bit larger than previous routers that I've owned4) The NETGEAR website is easy to navigate and both software manual and latest firmware are easy to find under the Support section5) The NETGEAR technical support team has surprised a lot of customers by aggressively addressing the early release technical issues this router had and have successfully fixed most if not all of the problems.CONs1) Price is high at $300, but there is currently no competition for this class of WiFi router...yet...Asus will be releasing their next-gen routers soon, so expect NETGEAR to drop the price on the X6 a bit to remain competitive with Asus!2) Does not support next-generation MU-MIMO technology.  There are rumors that NETGEAR may release a firmware update that will allow for MU-MIMO like capability, but don't hold your breath.  This router does not have the necessary hardware to officially support MU-MIMO technology (i.e. Qualcomm QCA 9980 and QCA 9982).Bottom line, if you want an excellent upgrade to your aging 802.11g or 802.11n router, now is the time to jump in and get this awesome router.  You will not be disappointed...unless that is if you have a thin wallet or really 'need' MU-MIMO  :-D

       "100936  Sometimes it&#8217;s nice to be outside and enjoy the silence. Sometimes it&#8217;s better to be able to hear the tunes you choose.This little speaker gives you the option. It is rugged and ideal for outdoors. It comes with a handy strap, and everything you need to charge it up and then take it outdoors for wireless use. I had a chance to try out one of these units for the purpose of a review. I&#8217;ve owned a lot of bluetooth speakers, but I really like this one for its compact, portable, rugged and accessible design.It hooks up via Bluetooth to my iPhone. Just press and hold the on button, and you&#8217;ll hear a voice saying: &#8220;waiting for bluetooth connection.&#8221; Then you have to turn on bluetooth on your phone, tablet or computer, and look for the Omaker M3 device name to show up. Select that, and it connects right away. The speaker will confirm that by saying &#8220;Bluetooth successfully connected.&#8221;It&#8217;s also set up for NFC connection, but I don&#8217;t have a phone or device that has that so I haven&#8217;t been able to test it.The sound is pretty good for such a small speaker. It can get quite loud, and it&#8217;s clear and strong. It&#8217;s not high fidelity, and won&#8217;t please audiophiles. I detect a little bit of noise, but it&#8217;s only barely noticeable. The bass is pretty good, but I think it sounds better with mid range and high notes. Still, it&#8217;s much better and much bigger than you&#8217;d get from the phone alone.It&#8217;d be a great speaker for camping or any outdoor activities &#8212; especially those where you&#8217;d be worried about splashing and inclement weather. Ideal for the poolside or the beach or for hiking where it might rain. (It isn&#8217;t water proof. There&#8217;s a cover for the USB and 3.5mm audio inputs, but it wouldn&#8217;t protect them if you immersed it in the water. Also: the grid that covers the speaker will protect from the occasional splash or light rain but would certainly leak if it went under.)

       "100937  This is an impressively tiny USB hub that isn't even given a proper title by the manufacturer, probably because it is so inexpensive they decided it wasn't worth the bother, so I am hereby naming it \"Mighty Mite\".It is a minimalist USB hub at 3 3/4 in. long and 1/2 in. square, plus the USB cable.The four USB 2.0 ports are lined up horizontally, 3/4 in. center-to-center.  Thumb drives may not be able to be inserted side by side if they are of the larger sort and total power output from USB 2.0 is limited to about 0.5 A, which won't support some USB-powered external drives and other devices.  Those are more than acceptable limitations for something of this size.Mighty Mite is perfect for instantly \"docking\" a notebook or tablet to a mouse, keyboard, thumb drive, etc., and multiple Mighty

       "100938  When my review sample arrived I was surprised by the size - it looks more like a multi-port USB stick with a pigtail than a hub. But a hub it is.Dimensions of the body are about 3 7/8 inches long by slightly over a half inch thick. It takes up very little space for road warriors and travelers, and if you are using a micro OTG connector for your phone or tablet like this one -Micro USB OTG Host Cable to USB 2.0 Adapter- this hib is the perfect way to expand it.I was concerned that this would not really support four devices simultaneously so I plugged it into my ThinkPad T61 running Windows XP. I populated the four ports with a mouse, a keyboard, my digital camera and my Galaxy Note 3 phone. I was especially eager to see if the phone balked because it's finicky about what gets plugged into it when it comes to synching and transferring. No problem with any of the devices (in fact I am writing this review using the external keyboard). I was able to read the camera's memory card with Windows Explorer while transferring a dummy file from my phone.  I did not test any of the claimed transfer speeds.Bottom line: this is small, convenient and works on my old laptop without a hitch. It may be only USB 2.0, but it's plenty fast for my needs. Especially since the only 3.0 device I own is my phone and I rarely connect it to anything but my 2.0 laptop. For what it is I rated it five stars.

       "100939  USB hubs come in all sizes, but this is among the slimmest I've ever used.  It is the perfect size for carrying with an ultrabook or tablet.  The build quality is standard, meaning no fancy braided wire or metal enclosure, but it should hold up for a while.  I tested the speed of a thumb drive with and without the hub and found that it did not slow down transfers.  It is not powered, so it won't be able to handle multiple power draining devices like hard drives, but it isn't intended to be used near a wall outlet anyway.  The appeal of this device is how tiny and portable it is.If you don't need USB 3.0 and want a super compact hub, this is a good one to consider.Thank you to Sabrent for the review unit.

       "100940  Simple design, easy to use, love having extra ports within easy reach.  This product is so small and lightweight, I've added it to the laptop case and replaced a larger, heavier one I travel with.  This hub was able to charge cellphone (galaxy - 3 different models), while having the mouse dongle, and plugged into the printer.  Loving it!  It also was able to transfer data and files between laptop and thumb drives without any problems.  I used the hub with the Sabrent 3.0 Card Reader, transferred photos off my SD and micro SD card with no trouble.  No CD, no drivers to download, just plug and use, couldn't be simpler.  After reading the warning about not charging the ipad, I was concerned about it charging the Kindle Fire HDX, but I plugged it in and it charged.  Plus!!  For the price, this is just about perfect.

       "100941  Trying to add extra USB 2 ports to a portable computer? Be it a tablet, laptop or other USB capable device, then the Sabrent 4 port hub, with it's light weight and easy portability is a great option for sure.I plugged this into my Surface Pro 3 and it was recognized immediately, no drivers needed. I've since plugged it into an older Surface Pro and my Windows 8.1 Dell XPS. The experience was the same. I then plugged it into my Windows 7 work laptop. No problems there either.Transfer speed is no better or worse than other USB 2 hubs.Just keep in mind, if you plug this into a USB 3 port, it will only work as fast as the slowest part, so in this case it will run as a USB2 hub because that's what it is.I can't stress how light this is. The ability to add 4 ports to my Surface Pro 3, so I can charge multiple devices from the SP 3, adds to the utility of it. Would it be great to be USB 3? Sure, but for me, it's not needed at all.Great device, easy to use and great portability.Recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from Sabrent.

       "100942  It seems like there are more and more USB devices I need to use with my computer. Just today, I had a USB mouse, a label printer and a Bluetooth adapter plugged into my laptop. That took up all 3 of my USB ports and left no room for my external portable USB speaker. And my Surface Pro only has one USB port! That's why I was delighted to have the opportunity to review this slim, bar-style USB hub.I was surprised to see just how slim and lightweight this hub is! That's a big plus when traveling with my Surface Pro because this will fit into my small carrying case. It plugs into a USB port and gives you three additional ports for a total of 4 ports from one. It doesn't need an external power supply and there are no drivers to install because it's plug and play. The drivers are installed the first time you plug it in.I plugged in 4 different USB devices and all ports worked perfectly however, I did get a message on my Kindle screen that it was plugged into a low power port and therefor wouldn't charge while in use and would charge slowly when not in use. Because the power from one USB port is divided into 4 ports, you should assume that it won't charge any device very quickly, but the devices can be used while plugged into this hub.Although this is USB 2.0 rather than the faster USB 3.0, it will still work in a USB 3.0 port - just not at USB 3.0 speeds.NOTE: Anyone with a computer will find this to be very handy and even though I was provided a sample of this hub for reviewing purposes, I liked it so much I just ordered 3 more for other family members.

       "100943  The world is going wireless and Sabrent wants you to join the public without spending too much money in the process. This very product is very similar to the Duo Bluetooth Receiver by CoolStream and it's ironic that they both showed up in the same time frame. It's the Geek God showing me a sign of comparing them to see which one is better for you and I - the average consumer.The little gadget that I want to share with you guys and girls today is the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver (WF-RADU). There's a lot to talk about something so small and very affordable. Let's get started, shall we?What's in the Box?Sabrent is known for packing their products very well to ensure that it will arrive at your house safe and still in one piece. Other competitors should take note and step up their packing game due to the fact that the customer will judge a product first on it's impression. Anyways, you will receive the:- Sabrent Wi-Fi Audio Receiver (WF-RADU)- User Manual- Customer Support InformationThey didn't include a lot mainly because this little gadget works with hardly anything extra.Where Does the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Exceed?Unlike it's competitor, CoolStream, this little gadget plays audio via your home Internet connection rather than Bluetooth. This means that more of your devices are able to play audio to a pair of wired speakers that can now become wireless with the simply addition of this little gadget by Sabrent.This means you can use your smartphone, tablet, Windows, and Mac computer mainly because the audio that is played to the little gadget is via AirPlay. Sabrent has even taken note that Apple has this pre-configured in their iDevices (i.e. iPod touch, iPhone, and iPad) as well as making sure that Android users has this benefit, too. On the other hand, Windows users are out of luck but that's a whole different story.Due to the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver playing music via the connection of Wi-Fi I have noticed that the signal was a lot stronger than Bluetooth. My Internet speed is pretty fast and the connection is solid no matter if I used a smartphone or a tablet.Where Does the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Lack?AirPlay is known for playing multimedia from iOS devices and since the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver depends on this it kind of kick some people in the butt. Basically, those users, like myself, that own a Windows Phone won't have the luxury to use this little gadget like those that own an iDevice or/and Android device. I will continue to search for apps that use AirPlay for Windows Phone until then this isn't a recommended product for Windows Phone users.Besides the lacking support for Windows Phone users I also see a BIG difference from their main competitor, CoolStream, which is that there's no built-in battery. The Duo Bluetooth Receiver from CoolStream offers a built-in 8-hour battery while the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver requires you to plug it into a USB port (i.e. Computer, Wall Outlet, etc.).How the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Fit in my Life?Personally, I don't see myself using this gadget mainly because the lack of support for Windows Phone as well as being required to plug it into a USB port just to power it. I do have the option to bring a portable battery charger but that's a bit much and I don't see myself having a big interest with it.I believe that this gadget fits better for a user that have a pair of speakers that are not in use but are near an outlet or/and computer and want them to use them again with the help of the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver. Basically, they will be able to control the audio in their home from anywhere inside and outside of their house.Why Should You Purchase this for Yourself?Do I recommend it? Well, yes and no; those that own an iOS and Android device should consider picking one up for themselves very soon but those that own a Windows Phone should wait until support is given either from Sabrent or an app in the Windows Store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "100944  This audio receiver provides a novel approach to wireless audio transmission, using WiFi rather than bluetooth. This item plugs in to any USB outlet for its power source. Once plugged in it can be linked to a wireless audio transmission source such as an iPad/iPhone or Android phone/tablet.  For this connection to be made you need to go into your phone/tablet WiFi settings and choose the Sabrent device from the available WiFi connections that appear. Then, you can use DLNA or Airplay supporting apps to play the audio and the audio should stream wirelessly to the receiver, which will play the sound through a headphone or speaker that you connect to the 3.5 mm output jack on the Sabrent receiver. When I tested this following the included instructions it worked smoothly. The sound quality is very good, better than bluetooth since the WiFi doesn't compress the audio. The drawback is that you can't have your device connected to any Internet WiFi source while it's connecting to the WiFi audio receiver. This item is also limited by the USB only power and the short length of the USB cable that folds in to the receiver. This could be used in your home as well as in a car where the vehicle has a 3.5mm auxiliary audio input jack and a USB plugin. This is a nice alternative to have available for wireless audio transmission from select devices. This receiver has red and blue LED indicator lights to show the presence of the WiFi connection and the audio transmission. Perhaps in the future this will be upgraded to offer more options, such as supporting other devices and offering a bluetooth connection for streaming audio from a webstream. It currently comes with a 1 year warranty and tech support in case you have trouble setting it up. I received a free item from the manufacturer for review purposes.

       "100945  TheSabrent Wifi Audio Receiverhas allowed me the ability to add wireless audio streaming to an older sound system that would never have imagined Wi-Fi existence in its time.  I used this system with a 3.5mm to RCA adapter cable to accomplish my goal and it has worked brilliantly.  One thing to keep in mind, you will need to keep this unit powered via a USB port, but for me that is simple enough.Setup to your sound output system is as easy as connecting the cable, connecting your device to the Sabrent will follow similar setup to that of connecting a device to a wireless network.  After plugging in the system and letting it boot up, on your Wi-Fi enabled device (phone, tablet, etc) search for the Sabrent_A1AE network and connect.  After successful connection, you can now play music wirelessly to your sound system.  I'm considering getting a second unit for the car because of how smart this setup is.  What makes this unit `better' than Bluetooth receivers is that Wi-Fi can offer better quality sound transfer and has a greater range than the max of 30ft you can get from a typical Bluetooth receiver.Overall, a solid performer and offers a unique solution to improve upon the myriad of Bluetooth receivers on the market today.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]

       "100946  Wow...that's about all I have to say.  Having no prior experience with BT speakers before now, I had relatively low expectations despite the glowing reviews.As one of the few reviewers who has actually purchased the speaker and thus has a bit of skin in the game, I can say that I am wholly pleased with this bluetooth speaker.  The overall performance and fidelity is exceptional and exceeds my expectations.While it won't be replacing my floor standing wired speakers, I can see where a pair of these set up in stereo format would create a very pleasing system suitable for many uses.Though I purchased the unit primarily for porch and deck duty, it sounds great in the kitchen and library as well.Thus far I've enjoyed music from disparate artists such as Charles Mingus, Donald Fagen, Simply Red, Lyle Lovett and Red Garland among others. They all sound great.None of my devices feature NFC but thus far I have had no difficulty mating the \"Roar\" with an iPhone, iPad, Kindle HDX and a Chromebook.I won't use many of the features provided on the \"Roar\" but for pure music enjoyment alone it is worth the asking price, imho.Highly recommended from a reasonably critical and picky listener.

       "100947  Update 14 July 2014: they have a white paper at creative.com/roar/whitepaper.pdfI have no doubt this is where I will put my money. 5 stars! ROAR!!!It is pointless to write another thumbs up review like what the overwhelming majority have done.Thus, for those who would like to look at its cons and how the cons may affect some, here they are:1) No audio volume indicator. It will be good to have some form of LED or even display.2) Too many features can confuse or up the learning curve. Some people just want the features simple, just do it.3) MicroSD Card support is only up to 32GB. If you have higher capacity, it may not work. My tiny 1GB card works.4) MicroSD Card needs to be formatted to FAT/FAT32. If you by chance have a NTFS one, it may not work.5) MicroSD Card playback lacks controls. You can play, pause, skip to next song, skip to next folder (by pressing and hold the forward button), random/continous play and that's all.You cannot fast foward play a song and so on. And yes, the buttons at the back are for controlling the card playback, not bluetooth. And you cannot use Bluetooth to control the card playback.Since the buttons are at the back, you could accidentally press back when you wanted to press forward.6) MicroSD Card playback does not support gapless. I know Windows Media Player since day 1 has support for it, same for a certain fruit company's products. My LG phone cannot play gapless too. If you need lossless audio, I am only in luck with wav. My WMA lossless does not work. My mp3 or wma 320kbps works.7) MicroSD Card playback is based on date/time the file is copied. FIFO. You cannot create a playlist. If you think you want to get this as a full featured jukebox, you might be disappointed. If you don't understand what is FIFO just use bluetooth.8) Bluetooth range is ok, but not always satisfying your expectations. My experience is the range is less than my wireless keyboard/mouse. If you are in an area full of bluetooth and wifi signals, good luck. If you keep on thinking about why the price is half of the competitor and why it is made in China, you may start losing confidence.9) If you looking at voice recording at 16bit 48kHz, you may want to ask Creative tech support how it could be done.10) Microphone to answer phone call is really ok, just ok only. A tad soft. If you have Soundblaster Axx 200, you will know what is the benchmark.11) To optimally and efficiently charge the roar, you will need to use the supplied AC charger, not any generic 5V 1A.12) Micro USB port is not very strong, just like Nexus 7 (2012). Take care if you plug in and out using USB cable daily.13) The device is a little heavy compared to speakers like Soundblaster Axx 200. If you are neither strong nor careful, let me know the drop test result. I have yet to.14) It is a rectangular box like device that occupies a large footprint compared to speakers like Soundblaster Axx 200. If you prefer a tiny footprint, do not get the Roar. To achieve optimal audio results, you may have to try positioning it near a wall, at a corner of the room and so on.15) Since it can connect to the desktop/laptop, you might think it can allow you to enjoy SBX effects on your favorite cans. There is no audio jack out. For gamers, there is no scout mode. Finally, changing SBX effects is not available through Android/iOS app.16) If you connect it to AC power and up the volume, you may find it louder than without AC power.17) If you find it too bassy, you might want to send it back for a refund. I have 2 suggestions. If you just want good mids/highs, small footprint/lighter/more features, better mic, get Soundblaster Axx 200. If you want to set it to neutral, connect to desktop/laptop, download SBX software (SoundBlaster Control Panel) and tune it.18) If you think it can outperform your 5.1 system/expensive soundbar, you will find its lack of stereo separation a regret. Solution is buy another Roar with the mega stereo cable to link up for wider soundstage. Note that the mega stereo cable is not an ordinary jack. It is slightly modified.19) The 6000mAh battery is non-removable, not user replaceable unless you are prepared to do soldering. My old Nokia feature phone battery is still working fine. Try to avoid draining the battery to zero too often, this can help to lengthen battery lifespan.20) The 5V 1A output can hardly charge large tablets. If you think of buying this just as a powerbank, think twice. After struggling to fully charge my LG Optimus Pro G (3140mah), it can hardly roar. Meow it goes.21) Battery life is ok, just plain ok. Nowhere near Soundblaster Axx 200. When battery life is low, it cannot output loud enough. You may want to buy a huge capacity powerbank for this.22) It is mainly dark gray in color. No other colors available including the accessories.23) Like any bluetooth device, you may have a device that is not willing to pair with it or you like to hear sudden pause in your music/audio.24) Like my Soundblaster Axx 200, you may have a certain laptop/desktop that somehow refuse to interact well with the Roar even after reinstall, reset, change micro USB cable and so on. Oh yes, older USB cables may not work well.25) It is not waterproof. The large horizontal top increases the probability of water invading the drivers.26) My Efergy power monitoring socket finds it consume more power during charging than Soundblaster Axx 200. 2 amplifiers means more power needed. To be fair, it still consumes less power than most 2.1 systems.27) No built-in FM tuner. So many features and yet this is missing. It was the standard in all Creative mp3 players (once upon a time...).20) No frequency response given. Doesn't matter. Certain frequencies are inaudible to humans. Give me a frequency response curve with SNR, that's better. You have a new fan and wants to know its rpm. I prefer to personally experience the wind (coverage, distance, timer, remote control) and noise from it during a hot afternoon.29) Creative is trying to make a comeback. Well, compared to some other brand that can sell very well even with twice this price, this brand still has some way to go. In fact, the Roar that you are getting today is like Roar 1.1 (some features added recently). I will not rule out a Roar 2 coming within a year that functions as a full jukebox too.I will update once I encounter new flaws.Last updated on 11 Jul 2014 :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "100948  The names Creative Labs and Sound Blaster are legendary among computer enthusiasts because they brought sound and especially music to computers. Early personal computers had no sound other than what was provided by a quarter-sized speaker only capable of making strange beeps and clicks people associated with old computers.The Sound Blaster quickly became the standard for adding high quality sound to the PC, first with an internal card and later using the USB connection. Sound Blaster is still THE name in PC audio cards with their high-end X-Fi Titanium product that they say can create three dimensional (3D) sound so accurate that gamers can locate their opponents by sound before they can even be seen.And now there is the Creative Sound Blaster Roar SR20A which redefines the simple Bluetooth speaker with five drivers including a built-in subwoofer. Power well beyond its modest size, the quality sound that sends music pumping out in seemingly every direction, filling surprisingly large areas with screaming highs and thumping bass, the speaker also has a number of well-executed, unexpected capabilities.I first heard about this speaker when a friend returned from the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Vegas last January. He said there was always a large crowd gathered around the Creative Labs booth where the new Roar was being demonstrated. He was impressed by what he saw and heard, but even after his slightly embarrassing gushing, I had no idea of all of the speaker's functions. After finally having one in my hands, and here is the list of everything it can do.Wireless speakerI use the Bluetooth 3.0 connection to play tunes from my iPod, tablet and laptop. The Bluetooth is seriously enhanced on the Roar, with 3 different Link Security (LS) modes controlled by a switch on the back,: connect two devices at once (LS mode 2, the default) and play one at a time, restrict to previously pared devices only (LS mode 1), or allow any device to grab control from the current device (LS OFF mode).It also supports near field communication (NFC) so you can connect by tapping the music player on the Roar. For conventional Bluetooth pairing, press the large tactile silicon button closest to the middle of the top of the unit (the multi-function button) and hold until the normally yellow light turns white and begins to blink. A voice says \"Pairing mode, waiting for a device to connect.\"The other buttons on the top are plus and minus to control volume, the Roar button, and the power button. The Bluetooth is very powerful, connecting instantly to my iPod from 15 feet away and staying connected even when I took the iPod into another room. Bluetooth modes supported are: A2DP (Wireless Stereo Bluetooth), AVRCP (Bluetooth Remote Control), and HFP (Hands Free Profile) for phone use - see below.Hands-free phoneWhen the phone rings while connected to the speaker using Bluetooth, pressing the multi-function button will answer the call, with the caller's voice clearly heard on the speaker. The Roar's built-in microphone is sensitive enough to conduct a phone conversation while several feet away. Pressing the record button during the call will create an audio file copy of the call in the Voice folder of the MicroSD card. Holding the multi-function button down for two seconds or more when the phone rings, causes the call to be ignored.Electric guitar practice amplifierPlug the guitar into the AUX IN port and play through the Roar. I have only been able to do this before with other speakers by first connecting the guitar to another device (the iRig from IK Multimedia) and then to an iPod, and then to the speaker. Plugging directly into the Roar I can be playing in seconds without worrying about the daisy chain of devices hanging out of my guitar. The sound was excellent and plenty loud to work as a practice amp at home or on the road.Portable file storageConnected the Roar to a PC through the USB connection, and copied files to the MicroSD card inserted in the Roar. MicroSD class 4 and above cards are supported with capacities up to 32 gigabytes (GB) when formatted as FAT16/32 drives.Portable music playerUsing the MicroSD card created above, the Roar is a portable music player, using the controls on the back to skip forward or backward, play the WMA, WAV, and MP3 music song files randomly, or repeating them depending on the switch setting.Battery ChargerI charged my iPod and phone to full strength using the built-in 6,000 mAh (milliamp hours) battery through the DC OUT USB connection on the back of the Roar. One of the three battery strength lights on the Roar went out after the charging was complete, indicating that about 30% of the battery power had been used.Sleep or stay-awake aidPlayed music all day, switching between Bluetooth and MicroSD, then went to sleep with the Roar gradually reducing the volume and turning itself off. I also tried the stay awake feature that plays loud voices to startle you awake, which was annoying, but effective.Alarm SirenSwitching the alarm switch from Off to Arm and pressing the Alarm button starts a loud undulating siren. Not quite as loud as a true home alarm siren, it is still plenty ear-splitting. Slide the switch back to off to stop it. If you got lost in the forest, this would help rescuers find you quickly.Computer Audio SystemConnected the Roar with USB to a Windows PC with no speakers or audio drivers, and loaded the SoundBlaster control panel software from the website. The SoundBlaster control panel includes the SBX Pro Studio which enables the creation of sound templates that can be loaded on the Roar to tailor the sound to different sources and environments.There are 9 pre-made templates that will probably suit most needs without creating new templates. Templates are loaded to the Roar by clicking or touching them, it is as simple as that. My favorite for both music and video viewing is the Stadium Surround that uses special effects to trick your ears into hearing spacious surround sound that I find really enhances the experience.The other 8 provided templates are SBX Default, Warm Sound, Smart Volume, Dynamic Boost, Night Sound, Clear Dialog, Clear Comms, and Cinematic Action. Without the Roar, sometimes it is difficult, even with the volume cranked all the way up, to hear dialog and music from videos playing on my laptop. With it, there is enough headroom to blow the roof off.Sound EnhancementsPressing the Roar button acts as a loudness enhancer when maximum power is desired, such as in noisy environments. Using this feature seemed to significantly boost the bass and vocal range of the speaker. The manufacturer also recommends plugging in the power adapter which also provides extra volume compared to battery mode operation.There is also a \"Tera Bass\" mode that, if desired, boosts the bass levels at lower volumes. It is activated by pressing the Alarm button on the back of the unit while the music is playing. While the bass did seem slightly over emphasized using this feature, I liked it, though that is purely subjective, dependent upon the user and type of music being played.AccessoriesA Mega Stereo Cable is available, allowing two Roar speakers to be used together, with the Master left speaker controlling the right speaker as a slave. And, a mesh carrying case permits the speaker to be easily transported and the mesh panels permit it to be played without removing the case or muffling the sound.The Roar has joined my cell phone, iPod, and PC as essential technical devices used throughout the day. The quality, seemingly endless features and reasonable price make this device beyond impressive. Opportunities are continually presenting themselves to put it to use to improve the experience of whatever activity is occupying my time. There is no going back.Review unit provided by Creative without obligation.   \n",

Occasionally, Kindle doesn't have a book I want but Nook does.  Also, Nook may not have a book Kindle has.  Also, Nook books have the page perfect series, as well as Enhanced Editions with embedded videos and audio clips, neither of which Kindle has.The Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can drag things from your PC to the Nook.  If you want more space for your stuff, you can get any sized san disk for the Nook.  I have a 32 gb one because I transferred about 4,000 pictures to my Nook and am using an app to edit the pictures and then make slide shows of them. Then I'll drag the shows back onto my computer and burn them to disc. Did I mention the Nook is a joy to use?

       "      <td>When I first heard about e-book readers, I was skeptical and did not want to give up my precious collection of books. (I have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me!) But then I finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night, and due to being away from home for periods of time where I couldn't easily carry a dozen books with me.The first reader I had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin' Kindle DS readers with the full key pad. I was excited about that one, but the price was WAY out of range. I decided to try and go with the Nook (after my typical pre-purchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option) and I was so thrilled with it, I had nothing bad to say. I used that little beauty for a few good years, until I was forced to sell it to help pay bills. From the very moment the Nook left my hands I regretted it. I was certain I'd never find one that good again. And I don't believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still!Fast-forward to this Black Friday. The FIRST Black Friday when I actually HAVE some money to spend! And I am looking for a really good e-reader! I did come across the Nook on Amazon, and saw the new Nook Simple Touch, which intrigued me, because I wanted to stick with the e-ink display, and not have a full-size touch screen battery killer. Finally, I realized my love for the original Nook had never died, and it still had everything I could ever want in an e-book reader. I was even able to buy one from a vendor here on Amazon, who lived less than half an hour away from me, and it only cost me $50!!! I was SOOOOO excited!!Now, if only I had NOT wasted $5 on that stupid fake-leather black cover, that completely RUINED the casing on my Nook... :(</td>\n",

Not to mention the internet function is quite basic and everything is of course in einkConclusion:If you don't have to have a color screen or a touchscreen and just want an eReader, I think this is a great choice. I love some of the features on this and think they should have been on the NookColor. I definitely read a lot more books now and it's easy to take with me everywhere I go.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I have been working on my fiction writing skills, and wanted an eBook reader so that I could read a variety of other novels to learn from them.  The Kindle is a great device, but I really wanted a color screen.  The iPad would have been a nice option, but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large.  The myriad Android tablets on the market don't seem to get great reviews, though I suspect that will start to change once Android 3.0 is available.The Nook Color was a nice alternative.  Priced a little higher than some of the no-name Asian tablets, but far less than the iPad.  It supports multi-touch, has a decent color display, and the ability to insert micro SD cards into a slot near the \"loop\" on the bottom.Because it supports both ePub and PDF out of the box, you can find a nice selection of books to download (legally) on the web and read on the device without additional investment.  The Barnes and Noble site also offers a limited, but growing, selection of electronic books (both free and for-a-price).  If you get tired of reading, you can use the built-in WiFi and browser to surf the web.  You can also play a couple of the built-in games, with the promise of more coming in a future update from Barnes and Noble.My only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive, the micro-USB connector is a non-standard type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable.  The connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable, which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while it's charging.Apart from that, battery life has been really good.  I rarely have to plug it in before I am finished reading for the day.The built-in web browser works well, displaying pretty much any web site that an iPad or Android phone can handle.The WiFi seems to find and hold on to signals well, and I don't recall it dropping a connection so far.If you take the time to learn how to \"root\" the device, you can add the Android Market to it and many apps (like the Kindle app) work very nicely on it.  This gives you the best of both worlds in a sense... The ability to buy eBooks from Amazon and Barnes and Noble, while keeping your color display.As far as eye strain goes, I work at computers 8 or more hours a day on the job and more when I get home.  I find the Nook's display easy to read for hours at a time and don't feel that my eyes are any more strained than when I read a printed paper book.  But your mileage may vary.  If e-Ink works better for you, the Kindle is a great alternative.I like the ability to highlight parts of the books I'm reading, take notes inside the book as I read (e.g., to highlight particularly good dialogue, characterization, description, etc., as a writer), and to post updates to Twitter and Facebook about your progress through a book.All in all, this was my favorite 2010 Christmas gift and has (for me) eliminated any desire to own an iPad or any other eBook reader.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I bought this product used from a coworker's daughter who was phenomenally underwhelmed by it. It is heavy and slippery. The capacitive touch is not perfect, and the narrow metal rim of the screen ensures one ends up touching the screen and changing things inadvertently. There is only one option for a page turn; lefties beware. The battery life is far shorter than the time necessary to read a medium length book, and the plug-in is at the bottom of the unit. Since the cable is specific to the NC, I hated to risk bending/breaking it as I can imagine it is pricey to replace so plugging in the unit usually meant it was time to put the unit down for a LONG time while it recharged. I traveled with this unit, and it did not get me from one airport to the next on a charge. A lot of the ebooks I own are in .pdb format, which B&amp;N sells, but the NC does not read. I was having problems with the unit not doing the motion side-turn and read thingy, and B&amp;N pretty well ignored me. The local manager reminded me that used units are no longer subject to help. (The concept of the unit being less than 4 months old when it died, and turned on twice before I bought it, didn't bear any weight.) A local computer repair guy charged me $60 for absolutely no help at all; apparently the NC is far too complicated for anyone but a B&amp;N repair person which never bodes well. Now the unit, fully charged, will not turn on at all; again, no help at the forum. Since for $40 more one can buy a ViewSonic gTablet with 10\" Multi-Touch LCD Screen, Android OS 2.2 and download reading apps for it, I'd say forget the Nook Color.</td>\n",

Once that is done, You can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering B&amp;N; store.  It's still there but, not right in my face. Default browser is OK  but, I prefer Dolphin HD.  It's much more than half and Ipad at exactly half the price.  Plus, when used as a reader, it's just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose.  I had a Pandigital novel that I got for Xmas that completely died in 3 weeks.  I took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that I can remember making:  The Nook Color.  The novel is pure garbage compared to this device.  Android 2.1 is so much better than 1.6.  I also couldn't get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything. Spend the extra $ and get the color.  Save the extra money from the Ipad. I was considering Archos 70 but, I couldn't find anywhere to actually play with it.  Plus, given their history; I had decided against it.Good:Nice screen,  capacitive touch,  strong wifi, decent battery life, Nice CPU @ 800 MHz,  512 MB RAM  Ipad only has 256  supposedly), Tons of free apps available, very reasonably priced,  portable,  Barnes and Noble magazines  very reasonably priced at $1 to $3 an issue), microsd slot.Bad  minor complaints):that silly plastic thing in the corner, mono speaker, micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot, doesn't come with android market.Overall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a while.UPDATE.  Couple of small annoyances: randomly reboots instead of sleeping, wireless doesn't come back up sometimes after rebooting.  Still very happy with it though. Sleep issue apparently also happens to those who haven't rooted.  I'm sure it will be fixed with update.UPDATE:  I am very unhappy with Barnes and Noble's many attempts to update my firmware without my permission.  They have tried twice and didn't succeed.  I believe that AVG antivirus is stopping it.  They got my girlfriend's and we have the same nook, that came with same firmware, that was flashed with same mod.  The only thing I can think of was AVG must have stopped it.  They got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine.  She wasn't running AVG and mine was.  It's the only thing I can think of.Who else does that?  I have items from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, HTC (Sprint), etc and NONE of them update my property.  Who do these people think they are? Well, they won't be updating my firmware and now I won't be buying books from them either.  Anyway, it's an aging piece of hardware and now for a bit more money something better can be bought.Side Note:  I had ordered a touchpad from B&amp;N; back on AUgust 21st.  Not only did I not get one, they cancelled my order for me without so much as an email.  Not very nice.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Last year my husband asked me if I wanted a Kindle, because I love to read all the time and I try to be eco-friendly when possible.  I was intrigued, but my biggest weakness is magazines and I didn't like the availability or look of them on the Kindle.  When the iPad came out, I was blown away by the beauty of it, but felt like for a few dollars more I could just get a whole new laptop and it would be almost the same size.  For travel, the iPad seemed to big and fragile for me; I need to be able to jam all my toys into my backpack and not worry about them.When I stumbled onto the Nook Color, I absolutely flipped my wig and couldn't wait to get one!  Full color magazines, that look just like they do on the newsstand!  This could single-handedly save the rain forests - I seriously buy a LOT of magazines.  I also save them forever because you never know when you might want that one article or photo again, which drives my husband crazy.  So perhaps the Nook Color can save my marriage as well!  That's a lot of expectation to put on this adorable little device, but I think it's up to the challenge.Santa decided to come early to our house, so I just started playing with the NC a few days ago, and it is my first e-reader.  It was almost fully charged right out of the box, so I was able to start playing with it in less than an hour (it says you can use it while it is plugged in, but they keypad is VERY oversensitive when plugged in so I don't recommend it).  It easily connected to my home wifi and linked to the Barnes &amp; Noble account I had set up earlier that day.  If you don't have home wifi, you might have to visit a public wifi location in order to activate it.  I recommend setting up a B&amp;N; account beforehand if you intend to purchase anything from there, as it makes the first-time Nook use very smooth and enjoyable.BOOKS: There are many many books available from a variety of online sources, check the product details for formats (please note it does NOT support Kindle format).  I understand it's also easy to download books from your local public library, though I haven't tried that yet.  The B&amp;N; Shop function within the Nook itself is the easiest interface but certainly not the only option.  While reading, it's very easy to adjust the font, screen brightness, and more to make it as comfortable as possible on the eyes.  At night I turn the brightness all the way down and find it very comfortable for my eyes while reading in bed.  I've read for hours on end without any sort of headache.  I haven't used the highlight, look-up, or share functions very much yet, but they're super easy to incorporate if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Page turning is an intuitive flip of the finger, or you can tap the side of the screen to move forward or back.CHILDREN'S BOOKS: The color on these looks amazing, and the \"read to me\" feature is wonderful for little ones learning to read on their own.  I imagine this would be great fun for a kid stuck in the back seat of a car for a long trip too!  There aren't a ton of Read to Me books available yet but they are adding more every week.  I don't even have kids but these are pretty awesome.MAGAZINES: Obviously this was a major feature for me!  The appearance of the magazines is absolutely gorgeous, the text and photos are clear and sharp.  You can use the \"finger pinch\" method on the touchscreen to zoom in and out, or you can use the \"Article View\" feature to pull out just the text of each page at a pleasant reading size.  The magazine includes every single page that you'd find on the newsstand, including advertisements, which to me is a benefit because I sometimes enjoy the photography and trends those provide.  Magazines can be read in portrait or landscape format, and you can flip through thumbnails at the bottom of the page to reach a particular article.  Most of the currently available magazines offer a single-issue purchase or a 14-day free trial, then bill you monthly for as long as you want to receive issues.  Subscriptions are very easy to manage so canceling is not complicated.  So far there are about 80 magazines available, and the number seems to be increasing regularly.NEWSPAPERS and PDF's: I haven't tried these yet, though some have reported formatting that make certain ones difficult to read.  The ones purchased directly through the Nook store are more likely to be formatted appropriately for the device and easier to read.  Better PDF support is likely to come in a future firmware update, though a lot of it depends on how the original publisher sets up the file.INTERNET: You do need a wifi connection to go online; 3G is unlikely to be available for the Nook Color unless you also purchase an accompanying data plan.  So far most web pages look crisp and beautiful, but are not as fully functional as on a laptop or computer.  Flash functionality is not available yet (but is planned) and a lot of people are experiencing difficulty with email and other text box typing.  I believe this will be fixed very soon, but for now the web is more of a \"read-only\" experience.MUSIC: You can load your own music or use the included Pandora app to link to your Pandora account.  The speaker isn't great so headphones would come in handy.  I'm extremely in love with my new iPod Nano so I will probably strap that on while reading rather than use this feature.VIDEO: Our first try produced some choppy playback, but I think the processor was very busy setting up the hardware because we had just gotten it out of the box.  After that, it played everything perfectly with jaw-dropping video quality!  It will play videos in MP4 format, so get yourself a converter and a microSD card and load it up for your next trip!  Apparently videos can also be side-loaded through the mini-USB cord.  I've only tried it on the card; it reads directly from the card with no problems.OTHER: You can add your own photos to use as background, or just to show friends.  It comes pre-loaded with a few games (sudoku, crossword, and chess) which work well and are fun.  \"Lend Me\" is an exclusive feature that allows you to swap books with other Nook users, and you can find groups of folks online who will swap with you if none of your friends have a Nook.  It uses the android operating system, and an app store is scheduled to open sometime in early 2011 so there will be much much more available in the coming months.I'm the type of person who doesn't need my phone to be a camera, my iPod to be a dvd player, or my e-reader to be a laptop.  The Nook Color does a WONDERFUL job as an e-reader of not only books, but also magazines and newspapers, and it has some other fun bells and whistles.  It does what it's supposed to do very well and the additional features make it a great value for the price.  I would give it a million stars if I could!</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'll admit up front that when I chose the Nook over Kindle and Sony's e-reader, I was impressed by that nifty full color touchscreen at the bottom of reading screen.  Glitz does not equal function, as I promptly found out.To be fair to Nook, if ALL you want to do is read, the device works, and works pleasantly.  I received my Nook in February, so it had the latest firmware updates, and I experienced none of the delays in downloading, missed sections of books, delays in page turning that early reports noted.  But if I was attempting to do anything more than clicking the page turning buttons, OUCH!The nifty little full color touchscreen (NOT to be confused with the e-paper reading screen, which is permanently gray-scale) just can't do it's job.  It responds slowly and inconsistently to touch, is quirky in its response, and virtually (no pun intended) unusable.  The virtual keyboard:  what a nightmare.  It's a true challenge to type more than one or two words without making an error, and trying to fix that error degenerates into a tragi-comedy in short order.The unit itself is pleasant to the hand, and comfortable.  It's also darn slick in its appearance, and if aesthetics  are your only criteria, well, go for it.  But here is why I returned the Nook after one week:  any optional feature, such as bookmarking, highlighting text and annotating it, search functions for previous book marks and annotations:  purely a nightmare.  The processor of the Nook appears to be vastly underpowered, and each instruction you give the touchscreen results in a wait that seems interminable.  It took me 30 seconds, AFTER I got good at it, to highlight 3 lines at the bottom of a page.  Simply not acceptable.Battery life:  might have just been my own unit, but in 7 hours: dead.  I also experienced two full scale lockups, with all buttons simply refusing to work for several minutes.The Nook's only advantage, as far as I can tell, is access to significantly more free content than you can currently access on Kindle.  Not worth the incredible frustration of wrestling with a device that went for touchscreen technology, but forgot that the touchscreen needs to be FUNCTIONAL before you bring it to market.Update as of 2/11/2010:  I purchased a Kindle after returning my Nook, and have been using it for three days.  Wow.  What an incredible difference in terms of ease of use.  The keyboard is very functional, bookmarking and note taking is effortless, the dictionary function (move the cursor to a word, instantly a definition pops up) is wonderful. Battery consumption is imperceptible, after 3 day, no visible drain (my Nook lasted 7 hours).  Downside of the Kindle?  Books whose copyright had expired (e.g. Wuthering Heights)that were FREE on Nook, are 99 cents on Kindle.  Nook lists all vendors of a given book, with prices conveniently visible, Kindle does not.  Irritating.  Lastly, Nook had a tiny clock in a corner of the screen, which I found very useful.  Not available on Kindle.  Overall:  for my needs, no contest whatsoever: Kindle</td>\n",

       "      <td>IMPORTANT UPDATE ON 3-24-14: This post is kind of backwards but I would rather not re-write it.  Essentially, if the package comes with a driver disc, use that first.  You may have to set it for compatibility mode for Win 2000 or XP and maybe run the installation disc as an administrator as well.  If that doesn't work well or is buggy, see [1~ below.Create a Restore Point using the \"System\" icon then \"System Protection\" in the Control Panel before attempting this.Wacom does not supply a driver for this unit for Windows 7 if you search the list, including legacy drivers, at their website.  I did, however, find a driver which I installed today on my new computer and it's working great so far.  This is the name of the driver file:  (Wacom) cons521-6a_int.exe which can be found as of today, here:  http://www.wacom.eu/index4.asp?pid=29&amp;list;=allNow, if you have Win 7 and plug in your Tablet, the computer will probably (as it did on mine) install a generic driver which does allow the tablet, stylus and mouse to work but it does not include a user interface for setting the fine adjustments of the devices.  Practically useless.  You can install the disc if this package comes with one and see how that goes.[1~ If you have problems though, I would uninstall the drivers and the DEVICE and then RESTORE THE COMPUTER to your last restore point.]When that's done, install the file above, shut the computer down, cut all power to the computer or pull out the power cord to flush recent memory, plug in the tablet with the power still off and then restart the computer.You will be able to access the GUI for the tablet from the CONTROL PANEL since no icon is present in the system tray for easy access.  You will see an icon called \"Pen Tablet Properties\".  Do not use \"Pen and Touch\".If you want to incorporate \"swipes\" because you have a touch screen, I'm afraid you're on your own.  I don't have one.  The \"Pen and Touch\" interface includes that feature but it may conflict with the other GUI's settings.  Use your own judgement.This tablet, pen and mouse set is still working great for me.  I need to mention that it does NOT require batteries.  The tablet plugs into your USB port and that's it.  The pen and mouse are sensed by the tablet and never need batteries.  The driver software allows for easy switching from \"What you see is what you get\" pointing to old-fashioned regular mouse behavior on the fly.  That is, if you prefer to surf the Web with the mouse set on a fast speed to get you across your monitor faster, you can easily switch it over then back again for drawing or editing images.Here's how to set it up:  Go to the Pen Tablet Properties GUI.  Set one of your pen's two buttons to activate \"Pop up window\" which will show a pop up menu on the screen when you press it.  Go to the Pop up menu tab at the top.  Choose from the drop down list \"Pen mode\" and then \"Mouse mode\".  Do the same for the Mouse.  I used the wheel \"click\" for the pop up menu assignment since I've never used it for anything else.  Now you will be able to switch between the two modes (assuming you've set them up with different parameters) by pressing the button for the pop up menu and clicking your choice.Questions?  Comment me.ORIGINAL POST:I bought this a few years ago so I don't know about availability of drivers.  Check with the company first to make sure it's compatible with your pc or mac.  I do all kinds of art work and this product is indispensable for doing anything which requires multiple strokes with a mouse.  Also much more accurate than a mouse for doing photo retouching or anything where fine detail is important.  You may think you're pretty good with a mouse and don't need this but I can promise you that once you start working with one you will be addicted.  I have done some serious work with this model and you don't need to spend more unless you are a professional.  The pressure sensitivity levels are more than adequate for me.</td>\n",

If you're upset this does not have the range/power you want \"out of the box\" then write to your Congressman and ask them to relax limits the FCC places on these devices. Or \"open the box\" and tweak the master volume knob. Just know there IS a legal cap on performance for any consumer FM transmitter, and it is ignorant to blame the manufacturer. All transmitters are subject to this rule, and this one is unique because you can override that setting (at your own risk).This device is unique because you can:a) choose ANY frequency (not just 2 or 3 set at the factory)But your results will vary by frequency. You MUST research what stations are used in your area, and find some \"dead space\" between channels. This sweet spot will vary if you are mobile between home and work, for example.In my area, the default station 88.3 has a strong public radio station, so I found 90.5 worked best. There are websites that will show you station strength and distance based on your postal code... they help. Don't expect to get a good signal on a thin slice between 2 strong stations.b) You can \"boost\" device power using the internal screw (VR2) trick documentd here. It works. Just don't turn it up more than you need... maxing it out can easily interfere with radio reception on or near your frequency choice. If everyone on your street can't tune in a valid station, you are asking for trouble from the FCC.As a new owner, I should add the following about the disassembly:Notice the \"volume wheel\" that protrudes through the case? That can easily snap off during disassembly. It's almost impossible to remove the cover without putting SOME stress on the wheel (a little bit does not break it but YMMV). At the very least, first make sure this wheel is at MAX (so IF it breaks off, maybe it's just stuck on max boost).Near the antenna, they use some gummy glue to hold the case together. Just carefully pry the case apart. To avoid losing control during this step and stressing wires, I used a wide flat screwdriver and twisted it (providing just enough separation force to pop the glue on that side).This was easier than it sounds, but if you are clumsy with a screwdriver then get someone to do it for you... or skip this type of device, and get a long audio extension cable.Works on any headphone port, such as my laptop and my mobile PC (Nokia N800 Linux tablet)</td>\n",

       "      <td>The BDP-S6200 lives at the top of Sony's North American bluray players range for 2014. This player is essentially a replacement to the well liked 2012 BDP-S790Sony BDPS790 3D Blu-ray Player with Wi-Fiwith a few features removed, but a few features added. More on that in a moment.The player keeps the familiar XMB (Cross Media Bar) interface just like its previous players. Its functional but I can't help feel its days are numbered since Sony has done away with it on their TV range. You can choose to start the player in the Sony Entertainment Network portal if you wish ... but it really doesn't offer you anything different from starting the player normally within the XMB.This top player gets a dual core processor (like the BDP-S790) so disks load fast and app navigation is zippy. A good test is to use the Youtube app that seems pretty CPU intensive. You can normally weed out under performers with that app .... but the BDP-S6200 handles YouTube very well.App support is solid enough, with new a new Crackle app that supports Crackle favorites. There is a new Hulu app too, but that was released across last years players too. The player also sees the new Netflix interface which is very nice too.The player also features a new Amazon App for 2014. It's certainly more visual than the older one but I think it's going to take a few software updates to get it tweaked just right.The player also has the Opera TV store with a bunch of apps in that too ... so you should be well supported for apps. Note, often asked but there is no HBO Go app on this player.The player itself, I think looks very stylish ... however if you are looking for more conservative styling, you may want to pick up a older BDP-S790. It doesn't seem as solid as the older BDP-S790 ... but it seems many mass market electronic manufacturers are heading in this direction as a whole, so I'm not really surprised here.Please note though, that despite Amazon's or Sony product description, there is only 1 HDMI output on the player !!Now, if you already own a 2013 x100 player from Sony, such as the BDP-5100Sony BDP-S5100 3D Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi, what does this new player offer?You will get the benefit of Super bit mapping (SBM) which improves color banding evident on internet video, improved DVD upscaling with additional levels of picture adjustment, IP Noise reduction pro for internet video, new audio enhancer, the new Netflix app, a new Crackle app and maybe a new Amazon app once it comes on line.For 2012 owners that have the BDP-S790, upgrading to a BDP-S6200 they get the benefit of the new audio enhancer, the new netflix app (with 5800kbps support), a new Crackle app and maybe a new Amazon app. They also get improved codec support in MKVs with MPEG2 and VC-1 video codecs. If they have a 2013 or above Sony TV, and appropriate BD media, they can take advantage of extended color (Triluminos). They also get screen mirroring with Android phone and tablets.They loose the extra HDMI output, Skype support and arguably less solid build.Again the player does not include a HDMI cable so buyer be pre-warned. Also, as with new bluray players, there is no analog outputs on the player so you're TV must support HDMI. There is a digital coaxial output for receivers that dont support HDMI for audio.If you do buy one of these and can't figure out how to get HD audio (DTS-MA or Dolby TrueHD) output from the player be sure to switch off BD-Audio mix AND the audio enhancer in the audio settings.Overall, its another solid Bluray player from Sony with some marginal improvements over last years player ... but nothing earth shattering. Recommended.Thanks for reading.- update 3/22/14The new Amazon App is now up and running, as is VUDU on the BDP-S6200. You will need to download a firmware update to enable these apps.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Powerbanks are usually not what I&amp;#8217;d describe as &amp;#8220;fun&amp;#8221; things to play with, but this one comes pretty close mainly due to it&amp;#8217;s novel way to display the remaining charge: you give the powerbank a shake, and the LED gas gauge lights up (1 to 4 lights that indicate charge level). It takes a conventional feature and makes it a bit fun to use.It also handles the practical basics very well. The overall design is well thought-out, with attached cables for micro USB and Lightning connections. That&amp;#8217;s a very helpful feature since I&amp;#8217;m always forgetting to bring cables along. This ensures you won&amp;#8217;t be left high and dry for lack of a cable.The build quality is solid, with tight seams and well-anchored ports. Visually it looks nice as well, with an all-black case with bright red attached cables. It&amp;#8217;s flat on the base and stands up on all sides without any wobble.The 8400mAh rating is more than adequate for a couple of phone recharges or a full tablet recharge. It&amp;#8217;s not the highest capacity out there, but the size/performance is a nice middle ground &amp;#8211; this measures about 2.5 inches wide and 4.5 inches tall, making it pretty easy to take along.Zero complaints about performance, and appreciate the thoughtful design (and the ability to shake it!). Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]</td>\n",

       "      <td>I live in a large, 2-story house with a basement. My modem and wireless router is on the first floor on one end of the house and I notice that signal strength is diminished on the second floor at the other end of the house. It is also very poor in the basement. I was really excited to have the opportunity to try this range extender (also sometimes called a repeater)  from TP-Link.So when you open the box, you find the Powerline Adapter, the Wifi Extender (the larger brick), and ethernet cable, a resource CD and a Quick Installation Guide. The Quick Installation Guide can be a little confusing for non-technical people so I will outline exactly what I did to set up the extender using the Wifi Clone feature, which is the simplest and fastest method.You need to be certain that your wireless router is WPS enabled. If it is, there will be a button with a special WPS symbol on it or above it. Your router doesn't need to be TP-Link brand. I have a Linksys e4200 and it worked perfectly. Then follow these steps:1) Plug the Wifi Extender (the larger brick that says Wifi AV-500 on it) into an electrical outlet near your wireless router. NOTE: It cannot be a power strip - only a regular, built-in electrical outlet.2) Press the WPS button on your router for 2 seconds (no longer)3) Press the Wifi Clone button on the Wifi Extender for 2 seconds (no longer). It's at the bottom of the row of lights on the front of the extender - it's a little hard to see. Note: It is NOT the reset button located near the two ethernet ports on one end of the extender. The Wifi Clone button will blink slowly for about 20 seconds, then all the lights will be on for a moment, then the Wifi Clone button will begin blinking quickly, which tell you the cloning process is complete. It is now set up on your wireless network.4) Now plug one end of the ethernet cable included into your wireless router.5) Plug the other end of the ethernet cable into the Powerline Adapter and then plug that into an electrical outlet.6) Now you can move the Wifi Extender (the larger brick) to an electrical outlet in any area of your home that has poor wifi strength and you're done! NOTE: Again, you cannot use a power strip - only a regular, built-in electrical outlet.This process clones your current wireless network so all of your devices will simply log into your network as usual, but with much better reception. Additionally, you can add up to 7 additional Wifi Extenders to strengthen reception in very large areas or homes with multiple floors. I have ordered another of these kits, since at the current price of ~$58 it is less expensive than just ordering a single extender, to place in the basement so I will have better reception there, too.You will notice that there are 2 ethernet ports on the bottom of the Extender. Those are for devices that do not have wireless capabilities.If your wireless router doesn't feature WPS, you can also configure it manually through a web application. You can also build a new wifi network with this kit. The directions are included in the user's manual found on the resource CD or (my preference) download the full users manual at tp-link dot com.This has worked flawlessly for me. I do have occasional internet drop-outs but I had those long before I got this kit. (I suspect it is my ISP.) My son can now stream Netflix to his Kindle in his bedroom whereas before, there wasn't enough signal strength to do so. In the room furthest from the router on the second floor, we can now watch streaming video without the constant, annoying buffering.Also at tp-link dot com, you will find a firmware upgrade. Look on the bottom of the Wifi Extender for the version number and if you have V:1.0, the firmware upgrade is for you. You will download the upgrade to your computer and then follow the directions for installation. Note: TP-Link recommends disconnecting from the internet before performing the firmware upgrade and I agree. Simply unplug the ethernet cable that connects your wireless router to your modem before upgrading. Once the upgrade is complete, plug the cable back into your wireless router and you're done.Because there are so many variables with regard to wireless routers, electrical wiring, house configuration, etc., I am not surprised to see that this product did not work perfectly for every reviewer. However, if you buy from Amazon, you can easily return it for a full refund if it doesn't work for you. I'm very, very pleased my increased wifi signal strength upstairs.</td>\n",

I've often been known to have several devices plugged in overnight to every available receptacle, including those on my PC USB ports. If I'm in need of a rapid charge during the day, I much prefer the AC method of charging.Immediately when plugged in the Arctic indicates it's ready to power up with a blue LED light in the center of the device. The fast charge ports for devices that draw a heavier load such as tablets, the iPhone, and iPads are indicated by orange. They are stacked on one side of the Arctic and the other fast charge ports are beside them.On the interface of the device are LED status indicators that show that the individual USB ports are receiving power. For something like the iPad this is rather an extraneous feature because I do know when my iPad is receiving an initial power influx because I can hear a blink and can see not only a battery indicating my charge, but also the charging icon in the upper right-hand corner.FEATURES:&amp;#9658; 4.5Amp Total Output Ideal for Charging Tablet/Smartphone/e-Reader/MP3&amp;#9658; 4-USB Ports with Fast-Charge Capabilities, 2 Dedicated Tablet Fast-Charge Ports&amp;#9658; Dedicated LED Charge Indicator for Each Port&amp;#9658; Overload Safety Protection on Each Port Protecting Charging Devices&amp;#9658; US Plug. 2-Year Limited WarrantySPECS:~&amp;#9658; Input AC 100V x 240V 50/60Hz~&amp;#9658; Output DC 5V x 4000mA~&amp;#9658; Weight 3.5 ounces (99.2233g)~&amp;#9658; Power: 20W~&amp;#9658; LED indication: Mono Orange, Blue~&amp;#9658; Safety approval: CE, RoHsDimensions:&amp;#9658; Body only: 1.06&amp;#34;(H) x 2.08&amp;#34; (W) x 2.95&amp;#34; (L); 27 (H) x 53 (W) x 75 (L) mm&amp;#9658; With plug: 1.88&amp;#34; (H) x 2.08&amp;#34; (W) x 2.95&amp;#34; (L); 48 (H) x 53 (W) x 75 (L) mmINDIVIDUAL LED INDICATORS / STATUS:&amp;#9658; Slow Flashing: Charging output below 1000mA&amp;#9658; LED on: Charging output between 1100mA and 2000mA&amp;#9658; Fast Flashing: Charging output above 2000mA&amp;#9658; No LED: No devices plugged in or charge complete (&amp;#60;90% power)The Arctic charges quite well as expected, however there were a few things I would have either liked to see or preferred. I much prefer flip-down AC prongs, specifically for travel. The lack of them makes the Arctic better suited for home use only. At that, one should keep in mind that holding on to the box it came in will be preferable for storage.Not intuitive. Unless you have the small one sheet user manual, anyone else using the Arctic Home Charger may not realize which port is for tablets or iPads or other devices. I much prefer my USB ports to be labeled 2.1A and 1.0A. I've had some chargers that have dedicated ports for specific devices, but the Arctic doesn't designate to the user which ports are optimal the home user. Excellent charger, but could be better with the addition of flip-down prongs and port labeling.Sample provided for review.</td>\n",

I didn't realized until I finished setting up my apps and I don't feel like exchanging and starting over so I kept it. Especially after seeing I made it work.You won't be able to install everything you want on here so be wise on how you use the space. I keep NO files on here and just take what I need from Dropbox. For programs, I only have MS Office, a typography app, firefox, Photoshop CC 2014 and Illustrator CC 2014. I uninstalled any crap I wasn't using and if I need to code, I'll do just fine with notepad. I think with all said and done I have about 9gb of hard drive space left. Works for me. I just wanted it for on the go internet and quick drawing and editing.I highly recommend not multitasking when running Photoshop or Illustrator CC 2014. No one anywhere will tell you this okay to do and will try to sell you tablets with 8gb ram. Maybe a rare few will tell you 4gb works just fine. This is running on 2gb ram and it works but multitasking here is a no no. Huge files are also not going to end well. Another thing is that the stylus that comes with this tablet kind of sucks. What I did was buy the microsoft surface pen which also has wacom technology and it works way better.Other things I'd say is it does get finger prints on it very easily so a cover and screen protector is a must if this bothers you. Also I wish the AC adapter was longer. It has a very short cord.Sure knowing this, I could have waited for the surface pro 3 i3 processor coming out soon but this was cheaper even with the accessories I bought in addition to the tablet and does the same thing. Don't get me wrong, SP3 is a might fine device and can potentially do as it says and replace your PC and tablet but this little guy here packs a punch for the price and if you need it for basic, straightforward tasks, this is the one to get.</td>\n",

This touch screen works well, and that is an advantage over any Apple computer product (excluding tablets and cell phone.) I moved up from windows XP to this one, Windows 8.1. Learning the new operating system takes time, but is not difficult. The BIG problem with this computer is it's horrible network adapter, Intel Centrino wireless-n 2230. It works slower than my 1989 2400 baud dial-up modem! After updating its driver, there was absolutely no improvement. A Toshiba software update of 480 MEGAbits took over 8 hours! Now it has to be sent to Toshiba for replacement of the network adapter. I was told that they would likely be wiping my programs &amp; data in the process. That will cost me around 5 hours of time to replace upon its return. This is unacceptable in a 2-month old laptop. I have had computers since 1989, AST Research, Compaq, a previous Toshiba, and Dell. Never before did I have any problem that required a replacement of hardware in less than 4 years of constant usage to the hard drive. Additionally, their customer service reps are not well educated and despite claiming to have 24/7 Platinum Service, they are only available until 7 PM during the week, and are CLOSED every weekend.

This works great for downloading photos from my DSLR, cropping them, resizing them and even correcting the color (the display can be color-calibrated) before I forward them onto my boss. I've found two small problems that few will care about but here they are.The Wifi isn't very fast. I rarely get transfers faster than 1MB per second and usually get half of that even three feet from the Wifi router. In the same location my laptop regularly transfers 9-10 MB per second. Copying files through MTP transfers at 3-5 MB per second so that's the way to go if you don't mind plugging in a USB cable.Video and audio acceleration in hardware is missing some important codecs. The most surprising is that AC-3 (better known as Dolby Digital) is not supported. This is the most common audio format used on DVDs and the only format used for high definition television in the U.S. The native video player simply says &amp;#34;Unsupported audio codec&amp;#34; and you get no sound. There is also no hardware acceleration for MPEG-2 video which is the standard format for DVDs and high definition television -- the default video player says &amp;#34;Sorry this video cannot be played&amp;#34;.This means that if you want to drop any file on the tablet and expect it to play, you will need another video player which will support these codecs through software (MX Player plays every file I've thrown at it). If you want to maximize the battery life by using hardware acceleration, you'll need to reencode video from DVDs or HD broadcasts into codecs that are supported by the hardware like AVC and MP3. This is a surprising inconvenience since even my phone supports these in hardware.</td>\n",

The tablet is light, easy to hold with one hand, and the screen is big enough. My needs are fairly simple - I don't use the multi window functionality that Samsung has provided - it does work, but I simply have no need for it. Mostly I use it for browsing the web, processing and posting photos (taken with my 36 mp camera) when travelling, and watching movies. The tab pro 8.4 is pretty snappy while performing/switching between these tasks and the screen - 2560 by 1600 - is the sharpest you can get right now. Absolutely no complaints about any of that. The battery is fair and when I fly long haul I make sure to take an external battery pack with me (mostly for a piece of mind - haven't had to use it yet). The biggest con about this tablet is that it's only available as a 16 gig version. Sure, you can store media on the external microSD card, but when it comes to apps - you will have to prioritize the apps (some games run a few gigs!) that you will have installed. Overall I am pleased with the product.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I originally bought into the tablet game with the Acer Iconia A510, even though it's creeping up on two years of age, the tablet has aged pretty well. You only really notice slow downs when attempting to watch higher resolution videos or some of the more memory intensive games. I honestly wasn't expecting the Tab Pro to really wow me.I've recently upgraded to a Note 3 phone, and to say that the Tab Pro is a upsized version of my phone is pretty accurate. The aesthetics are almost exactly like the Note 3 body - from the plastic/chromed edging, to the look and feel of the home button. It's also as thin as my phone, which was really the most noticeable change from my Iconia. I didn't think my Iconia was &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; until I started handling the Tab.Performance-wise, I'm not a super user on my tablet. I generally just watch some you tube videos, stream some off Amazon or netflix, and maybe play a few games from the latest Humble Android Bundle. The Tab's taken everything I've thrown at it and just shrugged it off.If there was a complaint I could level about the Tab, it would be that the touch sensitivity doesn't seem to be quite as accurate as I'd like to be. When pushing the 2560x1600 WQXGA resolution, quite a few of the apps don't scale well and tend to make their various hit boxes for context menus tiny. I'm assuming that having a stylus like the Note series might help negate this issue, on the Tab it makes for a few frustrating instances of &amp;#34;stabbing&amp;#34; the Tab with my finger, trying to make the tablet register that I'm clicking on the tiny [X] box. Now that I've vented, I really can't think of any other issue I've run into with this tablet.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I have both. Here is my thoughts:1. Appearance:SoundLink 3 has a old-timer classic look. The silver part of the box is paint sprayed mesh. the black parts around have a fine texture on it. The top is soft rubber. The whole thing feels like a old radio (in a good way) with a modern touch. I personally like it better than the jawbone box or UE style, which is way too future-ish young-kids looking. SoundLink 3 is also pretty heavy. Won't be a good choice to carry around. All in all, very solid build.SoundLine Mini reminds me the Iphone. It is a whole piece of Aluminum, as least looks like it. Also heavy for its size. but much more portable.2. Sound quality:Low Volume: SoundLink3 sounds better than SoundLink2 hands down. When played at same low volume, soundLink3 is MUCH better than soundLink2 in my opinion. The sound is much more clear, vocal really stands out. the high pitch is better, but still not quite there. The mini actually sounds the best at low volume. SoundLink 3 has a \"deeper/wider/thicker\" sound than the mini, but some how the mini sounds more \"clear\" at low volume and my ear find it very pleasing.When I say low volume, I mean put it on my office desk. close the door and listen to it when working.High Volume: SoundLink 3 can get really loud. I can not bear how loud it gets when I crank it up. but I never liked loud music so keep that in mind.  For my life, I will never need that much noise. But you may want it. when turn the volume up, SoundLink 3 start to sounds better than the Mini. I am impressed it can go quite loud without much distortion. I am not saying mini is not loud. To me, Mini is good enough for my medium size room, I don't even need to turn it up that much for it starts to feel too loud. I don't know why I would ever need SoundLink 3's loud volume. Unless I want to throw a pool party.Base: The base on the Mini is just amazing. I still can not believe how such a small thing can pump out that much base. Very good. The main complain I have about UE boom box and Jawbone is they do have better high but the base is just lacking. But that again is a personal preference. My friend loves his UE box and complains every time when he hear my mini saying \"too much base no high.\" But I like the base a lot, the music is \"fuller\". My opinion, UE &amp; Jawbone sounds tin-can-ish. I don't want that much high with no base. But again \"sound better\" is your feeling, so listen to them and make your own decision.SoundLink 3 has good base, too. also it can maintain a clear layer of sound with that base. the base is not as heavy flavored as the mini. At low volume, I think mini has a more noticeable base. At high volume, soundLink 3 start to catch up.Conclusion:1. If you like full base like me, go for Bose, if you likes high pitch better UE boom may be better. it is cheaper than Mini, and has a microphone you can make call, also has a cool app. I totally don't care about those. I want better sound for music.2. For bose, SoundLink 3 can get much louder than Mini and it sounds better at high volume. If you want loud music so your office mate next door can go complain to the boss, chose soundLink3. If you only need to fill a medium office/living room with clear music, go for mini.3. don't forget mini is 100 less than SoundLink 3. For me, if I can only keep one, I will keep the mini, it is good for all my needs. But I will keep both, I may start a party in the hall way, you never know.--Update--One more thing:Do you know that the Bluetooth devices you use to connect to those speaker make a difference? I used Samsung Note phone, Iphone, Ipad &amp; Kindle HDX to test the same song on SoundLink3, they actually sounds different form each device. Which is very strange. Isn't this suppose to be digital? Anyway, They are obviously different to me. The best sound actually comes from my Kindle HDX, Ipad and Iphone are OK, Samsung note sounds the worst. So if you have more than one bluetooth device, try pair them all and find out if they really sound different or I am just crazy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>External batteries are a very important device for USB charged devices. Every year manufacturers create more advanced hardware and software while failing to create a more advanced battery; which leads to frustration because of the inefficient battery. Fortunately, Eachine has made the Eachine 3000mAh portable backup External battery Perfume power bank Charger as an external battery and flashlight for your USB charged devices.Inside the packaging is the flash light power bank, a 2-in-1 USB charger, a silk bag, and a user manual. I really like the simplistic design of the power bank, and the fact that it comes with a flash light. A lot of power banks this size don&amp;#8217;t include a flashlight, so this is a great feature.This power bank includes a apple 30 pin connector (4th gen iPod and previous models) and a micro USB connector. The length of the cord is about 8-8.5 inches with a white design that is similar to all apple cords. The gauge of the wire is also comparable to iPod cords.The included bag is made of a silk material and measures 5 x 2 inches. It can fit the power bank inside it very nicely but has issues when the power bank and charger cord is included. Most power banks don&amp;#8217;t include a bag, so this is a very nice feature to have included with the device.The power bank is fairly small and light (0.8 x 0.8 x 4.2 inches and 3 ounces). For the price of $14.99, this is the perfect present to anyone who needs the flashlight and power bank combo, and it also comes in four really stylish colors: red, black, silver, and gold. At the top face is the Eachine logo, a button which activates the flashlight, and an LED indicator (statuses below):When charging:Red LED = Device is chargingBlue LED = Device is fully chargedWhen On:Blue LED = Indicates device is on.I wish this device would include indicators other than the two LEDs. Many other devices would include at least four LEDs to indicate how charged this device is. At the bottom is a micro USB port to charge the device and a 5V 1A port to charge your USB device. I like that this is charged by micro USB, as this is a very common cord that can be bought at most convenient stores if it were ever lost, damaged, or stolen. At the top is the flash light that is activated from the button on the top face.I started by testing the time to charge the power banks (red, black, gold, silver). They all initially had the red LED and was able to successfully charge within 2.5 hours. These results are pretty good for a battery this size. I then tested the flashlight, and found that the light is very bright. I would definitely use this battery for the flash light alone. The button to activate the flashlight is very responsive, as I am able to turn the light and off immediately.I then tested this with my Nexus 7 (2013), running Android 4.2.2, with a 3950 mAh battery, and my iPod 4th generation, running iOS 6.1.6, with a 930 mAh battery. The connector for both the micro USB and apple 30 pin connector both aren&amp;#8217;t great fits. The connectors both have trouble fitting in their counter parts, which is unfortunate since this cord would save a lot of space. I started by testing my Nexus 7 (2013) and found that my device is taking the following from the power bank:0.36A5.26V0.5 Peak A5.21 Min VThese are good results, as my Nexus 7 doesn&amp;#8217;t take the entire 1A from the external battery. I then tested how long and efficient the battery was:Test 1:20% 6:45pm55% 7:44pm62% 7:56pm &amp;#8211; Red power bank overheatedTest 2:1% 12:23am19% 1:22am20% 1:23am &amp;#8211; Black power bank overheatedI was able to successfully charge my Nexus 7 (2013) 42% in 1 hour 11 minutes and 19% in 1 hour, but unfortunately the batteries over heated. This is disappointing that such a stylish looking power bank would experience such issues.I then tested this on the iPod 4th generation:0% 8:13pm - Gray100% 10:30pm - Blue light still and still charging930 mA h / 2.25 hours = 413 mA per hourI was able to charge the device from 0% to 100% in 2 hours 17 minutes. This is 413 mA an hour, which isn&amp;#8217;t horrible for any device, but isn&amp;#8217;t great either. I do want to note that this external battery does not have any automatic shut off when your device is fully charged, so please keep an eye on the charger while your device is being charged.I reviewed this product prior to the warnings that tablets weren&amp;#8217;t recommended to be charged. As long as you heed these warnings, this is a quality battery that is definitely worth every penny, and is why I give this product 5 out of 5 stars.Pros:+ Price at 14.99 is the perfect price point to anyone who needs flash light and power bank combo.+ Portable and perfect for travel.+ Uses micro USB interface for charging, which is a very common cord that can be bought at any convenient store if it were lost, damaged, or stolen.+ Very simplistic and stylish design.+ Choice of four colors (Black, red, gold, silver)+ Includes micro USB and apple 30 pin connector in one cord.+ Includes a very bright LED flashlight for the dark.+ Includes a silk bag that is able to fit the power bank inside, but not able to fit connector and power bank.Cons:- Not able to charge tablets.- Has no automatic shut off when your device is fully charged.- Includes a silk bag that is able to fit the power bank inside, but not able to fit connector and power bank.- Only two LED indicators: Red for charging, blue for fully charged and on. Most other power banks would include at least 4 LEDs to indicate charge.- Fit of the micro USB and apple 30 pin connector isn&amp;#8217;t great. They both have trouble fitting the connectors.I was supplied this sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On the 11-inch form factor, I've been a Chromebook user for almost 2 years now and my happy casual computing experience on a beautiful HP Chromebook 11 and on a Samsung Chromebook before that might have produced some Chromebook bias. To at least reduce it, because I want my reviews to be as bias-free as possible, I forced myself to use this Asus for at least one hour each day for the past several weeks. It wasn't easy and, after all these weeks, I am still a Chromebook user and, nothing personal, I will prefer a good 11\" Chromebook to a Windows 8 of the same size, touch-enabled or not, very much every time. I will explain why.PHYSICALI remember reading someone's remarks on how laptops are expected to 'travel around the world'. I do know a few world travelers but my experience is that most people do not travel around the world very often and my view is that the 11-inch form factor is meant to 'travel around the house' or fit into a backpack pocket and travel to school or to a friend's house. To that extent, each ounce counts because I want to be able to grab my little computer with one hand and move it around easily. When compared to my favorite HP Chromebook, the Asus machine feels heavy and significantly so. The Asus is also a lot thicker and it's a lot more difficult to open it, generally requiring two hands. The HP, on the other hand, is much thinner and feels light as a feather. It opens and closes easily and turns itself on once opened, with no need of more buttons pushing.I can see why, being heavier, the Asus benefits from a rougher, grooved skin because you need a better grip. However, the grooved finish is likely to make it harder to clean and I wasn't able to wipe out fingerprints with a microfiber cloth the way I do it on the HP.The Asus comes with its dedicated charger and it works well. Only the HP Chromebook, while charging faster through its own, can also use very much any phone/tablet charging device to at least keep in going and usually to slowly charge it in an emergency.PERFORMANCE AND SPECSThe Asus has better specs, on paper. The CPU is faster, has more memory, has its own hard disk and a large number of ports: 3 USBs, HDMI, card reader, VGA, Ethernet. But... wait... no Bluetooth, which probably explains the large number of physical ports. And the 802.11 Wi-Fi appears to be limited to 2.4GHz b/g/n and to not work in the 5GHz band. I prefer the HP Chromebook's elegant Bluetooth solution for connecting to various peripherals. Yes, it has fewer ports but, I must confess, except for sometimes using a USB dongle required by a mouse, I never felt a need for a physical port on it. Streamers such as Chromecast and Roku and various online services and 'the cloud' have very much eliminated the need for a physical HDMI port and I wouldn't want to see lots wires or any wires coming in and out of my little 11-inch gadget anyway.The Asus and the HP have similar screen resolutions supported but the Asus has 4GB of RAM, twice as much compared to the HP and it needs it because a computer needs a lot of RAM to support the ultra-heavy Windows 8 OS. Same for CPU speed. The Asus CPU is faster if we are to count cycles but it appears actually slower when in use due to the enormous Windows overhead.The built-in HDD, present in the Asus but not in a Chromebook, while of some (diminishing) utility, adds weight to the Asus machine and makes it run warmer that I prefer - I'm already used to the Chromebooks running silent and cool to notice even the low hum that the Asus HDD makes while churning through the Windows overhead 'stuff' and perhaps constantly checking for malware and file corruption.INTERFACEI actually love Windows 7. I also love the Chrome browser interface I get with Chrome OS. I can't stand Windows 8. It's bloated to the extreme, it's unnecessarily complicated and it appears to be more concerned with enabling Microsoft to suck in all the information it can from you, presumably to sell it to advertisers and who knows who else (ohh.. NSA, I forgot) and to promote its 'properties': Skype, Bing, Internet Explorer... I am not saying that Windows 8 can't be 'easy to use'. Yes, it can if you don't mind Microsoft telling you what's 'good for you' and doing exactly as told. If you want to deviate or customize a little... yes you can but, in my case, I ended up with a Chromebook-like interface, only a lot slower and harder to get to running on a hotter, heavier, noisier little computer.The Windows 8's inherent complexity gets even more annoying with this version's support for touch. It's 'neither here nor there'. The screen touch is poorly and unintuitively implemented in my view and my feeling was that I ended up with a dirty screen for no good reason. I believe 'touch' was an afterthought or a rush in Windows 8 and it shows. For example, when I click the touchpad on the login screen, a unneeded on-screen keyboard is displayed as if Windows doesn't know that it's running on a laptop with a permanently attached keyboard.WHY THIS ASUS?I am not sure if I wanted this as my everyday little laptop under any circumstance. Unless I felt that it was my duty to supply Microsoft and its business partners with loads of my personal data while sacrificing some convenience in the process. I use my 11-inch little computers for casual, in-house activities: watching movies in bed, reading the news while having breakfast, checking my emails, looking up things on Google or the Wikipedia, making quick phone calls, casting some Youtube videos to the big screen TV. All of the above are performed beautifully and easily by the lighter, thinner, cooler, easier to use, prettier and less expensive HP Chromebook. And I don't need to worry about viruses and constant and lengthy patches on it, disk crashes and file corruption or more bloatware stacking on top of pre-installed bloatware slowing everything down to a crawl. Yes, the Asus has a HDD and its sides are poked with various ports but I never felt the need of an HDD for my Chromebook and, the fewer ports that I almost never use the better. Yes, some laptops can and should be used for both 'home and office'. They tend to be significantly more powerful and can be used with add-ons such as 'docking stations' to allow for large screen, mice, full-size keyboards and other peripherals. This Asus should not be imagined as a home/office device.To conclude, this little computer is not 'for me'. I simply can't imagine myself connecting peripherals to a toy-like device made of home use through three (?), doing a wired Ethernet connection or attaching a thick HDMI cable to it. And I don't understand that lack of Bluetooth and its not supporting the 5GHz band for Wi-Fi when even $50 streamers do these days. My Chromebook bias and general dislike of Windows 8 noted, I simply don't like this machine. The ASUS has nice specs that maybe could be put to good use if Windows was replaced with some less bloated OS but, as is, I couldn't justify buying this machine. The \"don't like it\" should normally translate into a 2-star rating but I'm going to rate it as a 3-star, mostly because of the excellent display.</td>\n",

       "      <td>After going back and forth between the COSMOS 90GT WiFi and the NexStar 4SE for several weeks, I finally opted to go with the COSMOS 90GT for my first telescope.  I ended up choosing it for several reasons:1.  I liked the idea of the interface with my iPhone and iPad.  I had already been using the Celestron COSMOS Navigator App to just locate constellations and such, and I really liked the app.  The thought of using it to control the telescope was very appealing to me.2.  Call me a geek, but I kind of liked the COSMOS features on the telescope.  The light up SOTI, the COSMOS Eye Nebula, and the fact that it came with a Cosmic Calendar all tickled my fancy.3.  I live in a suburb of a small-medium city.  It's not too bright, but I do live close to a couple of facilities that have some fairly bright lights at night.  After looking around a bit and asking some questions, I found that refractors tend to be a little bit less affected by &amp;#34;washing out&amp;#34; from light pollution.4.  My main points of interest in the night sky were the planets.  Primarily Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn...along with the moon.  From my reading, the refractor telescope seems to be the best suited design for primarily viewing the planets.I ended up ordering the telescope after a few weeks of deliberation.When it arrived, I was initially impressed with the packaging.  The look and design of the box was really nice.  In fact, I plan on keeping the box to display in my hobby room, I was so impressed with how it looked.I set about opening the box and getting the telescope built.  In fact, I have a video of the unboxing, assembly, and first WiFi connection to the app.  I will try to get it uploaded along with this review.The telescope was easy to assemble.  I followed the instructions and had no problems whatsoever with putting it together.  A word of caution, when you are attaching the telescope mount to the tripod, don't tighten it as much as possible.  I did, and it was a real pain to get it loosened so that I could level the tripod when I went to use the telescope for the first time.  I've since learned not to tighten it as much as possible, just snug it up and then maybe another 1/8th of a turn and it'll be good to go.The only slight hiccup with the telescope for me was the finder scope.  I was able to get it aligned, however, it is at the extreme end of one of the adjustment screws.  Basically, it can't go any more in that direction.  I guess that doesn't matter, seeing as how it's aligned at about 1/2 mile very well, but I thought I'd mention it.  I wish it had just a bit more throw in that direction, because I'm a bit concerned that having it tightened down the way it is may cause it to eventually not hold.  With that said, I'll probably be replacing the finder with a right angle finder in the near future, simply for the ease of use.  When using the finder in the field for things that are up high in the sky, it can literally be a pain in the neck as you crank your body around to get to a point where you can see through the finder.After getting the telescope all built and the finder dialed in, it was time to see some stuff in the sky!!!Or...not.  Of course, the day I got the thing the sky was completely overcast all night.  I was then informed that when you order a new telescope, the UPS man usually brings at least three days of clouds with him.In short order, though, I was all set to get out and use the telescope.  On the day that I was planning to use it, I took it out to check the alignment of the finder scope one more time.  It was at this time that I had another self created problem.  When I was packing the telescope back up to take it home from where I was checking the alignment, I wrapped the cord around the battery holder too tight, and managed to pull one of the wires out of the crimp connector.  It was nothing a quick hit with a soldering iron couldn't fix, but do note that you shouldn't wrap that cord around the thing tight, because you might end up pulling a wire out!After getting that sorted, it was time to take it out to the field.  I have a few vacant lots behind my house, so I just took it out there and set it up.Connecting to the telescopes WiFi couldn't be any easier.  It's just like connecting to a home or work WiFi system, and once you've connected once you should automatically connect if there's no stronger WiFi signal in range.This was when I ran into my second self created problem.  It had gotten fairly dark, and I had absolutely no clue which items in the sky were considered &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; objects.  See, to use the alignment system on the telescope for it's automatic GoTo function to work, you must align the telescope to three bright objects.I tried first using the moon, and then two bright objects...at least they appeared to be bright to me...about 120 degrees away from the moon on either side.  I understood that using objects farther apart and in different parts of the sky works best for this.Alignment failed.I then tried using the moon and a star closer to it, then one on the other side of the sky.Alignment failed.I then tried skipping the moon and picking three stars on different sides of the sky.Alignment failed.Finally, I tried aligning it to two stars on one side of the sky that seemed the brightest, then one on the other side that was lower in the sky near some known light pollution.  My thought process was that if this star could be seen through the light pollution, it must be bright.Success!!  The system told me that it was aligned, told me what I had used to align the telescope, and then I was able to use it.I found that my alignment must have been off by just a few degrees, because as the telescope went to things, it was always off by the same amount.  Not so much that I couldn't see an object, but enough that a few clicks of fine tuning were needed to get the object completely centered.After checking around, I found the following tips for alignment.1.  Make 100% sure the telescope's tripod is level.  If it isn't level, then the telescope won't know exactly what you're looking at when you get objects centered, and the way it does it's calculations for alignment will effectively be confused.  I have found that using a level with the telescope mount not on the tripod works very well for getting the telescope completely level.2..Do your alignment when it's just starting to get to twilight.  Those first few stars that show up in the sky are the brightest, so if you use those you'll be getting three KNOWN bright objects.3.  Get objects centered in the 25mm eyepiece, then switch down to the 10mm eyepiece and make sure they are centered in that one, too.  There's a good chance that what you think is centered in the 25mm eyepiece is really a bit off.  I found when switching down to the 10mm eyepiece, I was always off a few degrees with my centering.  After getting the object centered in the 10mm eyepiece, &amp;#34;unfocus&amp;#34; the star a bit to make it a big fuzzy ball.  When you do this, you will more easily be able to see how close to the center of the eyepiece you are.4.  If you are trying to use the moon, you need to be very careful that you're actually centering on it.  The moon moves fairly quickly, so getting it centered can be tough.By following these suggestions, I've been able to get the telescope to align quickly and accurately on the first try when I use it.Anyways, back to the use of the telescope...Once you've got it aligned, I have found that the tracking and GoTo features work very well.  Even if the alignment is just a hair off, you'll always find what you're looking for.  I've been able to leave the telescope just sitting for about 20 minutes, then go back to it and the item I was looking at will still be right in the same spot on the eyepiece as it was when I left the telescope.Keep in mind, if you want to track the moon you must use the app to select a different tracking method, as the default is to track the stars.I wanted to take a moment to mention that the first time I was using the telescope, I accidentally pulled Saturn into view when trying to align the telescope.  I was in a rush to try to get the alignment done, so I didn't spend a ton of time looking at it...but once I had alignment done, it was the first thing I went back to.Seeing that planet was a very strange feeling.  It was mesmerizing, almost zen like.  It was easy to pick out the sphere of the planet itself and the separation of it's rings.  Switching to the 10mm eyepiece just made it more amazing.  I just looked at the planet for the better part of 20 minutes.  I was completely in awe.  For that little bit of time, it seemed like there wasn't anything in the universe but me and that object a billion kilometers away.  THIS was exactly the reason that I wanted a telescope...to lose myself in the stars and planets of the night sky.So far, I'm really loving the telescope.  It works well, provides great views of the things I've been looking at, and comes fairly fully featured.  I would suggest picking up a 2x barlow for some better magnification, but even without that you can still get stunning views of the moon, Saturn, Mars, and other objects in the sky.  So far for me, Jupiter hasn't been able to be seen...it hides behind the tree line that's west of my home.The tripod isn't the greatest, but it's also not as terrible as some reviews would have you believe.  Make sure when you get it you tighten all of the hardware.  Loose hardware leads to unsteady legs on the tripod.  When you need to adjust the focus, you will have to give the telescope a few seconds to &amp;#34;settle down&amp;#34; from the vibrations, but I think that's fair considering the tripod came in a kit that costs less than a lot of tripods alone cost.  I have found that if you suspend some weight from the center of the tripod, you can give the telescope a much more &amp;#34;planted&amp;#34; feel.  Experiment with that to see if it helps with your tripod's sturdiness.  This is an old photographers trick that effectively &amp;#34;loads&amp;#34; the tripod and forces it to be more sturdy due to the way the legs are now working.  Trust me, it works.There are a couple of things I'd like to see updated into the app itself.  I'm honestly hoping that this new way of connecting a GoTo telescope to a controller via applications on tablets will yield quicker updates, fixes, and additions.First, I would like to see some more alignment options.  It's my understanding that with other NexStar telescopes you can do a two star alignment as long as a few other things are in order.  I'd like that to be added.  I'd also like the system to be able to align if I point it at KNOWN stars and tell it what I'm looking at.  For example, I'm quickly learning the names of some of the things in the sky.  I'd love to be able to get Mars in my eyepiece, then tell the system I'm looking at Mars.  Then move to Antares, and tell the system I'm looking at Antares.  Once it knows that those two things are what they are, I think it should be able to align.Next, I'd like the app to run a bit smoother.  It runs very smoothly all the time...except...when the telescope is actually slewing to an object.  If you try to get it to do anything while the telescope is moving, it gets very slow to respond.  I've found that quitting all of my other running apps minimizes this, but it's still something I think might be able to be worked out of the system.Finally, the app tends to send the telescope in a direction that doesn't make any sense sometimes.  For instance, if I'm looking at the moon and want to switch to Saturn, even though Saturn is about 90 degrees to the left of where I'm seeing the moon, from time to time the system will send the telescope the other direction...so it must now move 270 degrees to get to where I want it to be.  I'm not sure if this is done on purpose for some reason that I can't think of, or if it's simply a strange glitch in the software.  Either way, having it take the quickest and most direct route to the object you've selected would help preserve battery life, and it would also take a bit less time.These things all seem like items that can be worked out of the system with an update, and I hope that will be the case.For everything that I've looked at, and the fun I've had, though, this telescope fully deserves the five star rating.I look forward to using it, and to getting some accessories to better my enjoyment of it.</td>\n",

PLUFF! Just went online for buying the one with the 500gb HDD inside the keyboard (yes, it's true, 500gb!). And... I didn't doubt it... if you are gonna get a tablet with a detachable keyboard and full WINDOWS 8.1 (yes... not an RT Windows; this one comes with a FULL WINDOWS 8.1 32 bits + full Office with original license) you should (must) get the one with de 500gb of HDD).Well, one by one :BATTERY - Wonderful !!!For me, one of the most important things about the item that I was looking for.For example: got it this last saturday, april 12th. I start using the tablet saturday night for about 2 hours with the original charge from factory (turned it on at 100%). Cup of configurations, WiFi, the essencial. Turned it off with 97%.Then Sunday: started again at 11 am next day. Copying from my external 500gb HDD to the keyboard (it has a blue 3.0 USB port) about 250/300gb of several files during day (video, images, exe, etc). Mostly with the keyboard connected. Lot of config. Checking Youtube videos, surfing the web, installing Avast, reading news, etc. Of course, closing the tablet sometimes for lunch, taking a nap ;-), going to the market .... and... went full offline at 11 pm!!Can't say anything but great things about the battery life.SCREENFor my eyes, I must say that it seems to have a beautiful, bright and clear image. I was watching youtube videos (HD quality), some 720p movies downloaded from Yify... all great.The touch: very accurate; you can do all the moves that you used to do with your mouse, right button menu, etc. Also you have the Asus gesture.. you can config what to do with your fingertouch.KEYBOARDBrutal... cool! Just great. Inside you will find a 500gb HDD. Also.. and important: when you are in the Windows 8 screen (with the icons) for example, if you want, you can install the VLC player from the MICROSOFT MARKET. Then (don't know much about this) I downloades and installed the full version of the VLC player (from the VLC website from Chrome). And this is the important: you can install everything you want directly on your 500gb HDD, without problem. Another example: just installed the Corel 12 on the 500gb HDD and runs perfect! (another tip there you have: the COREL 12 works wonderfull with this processor).Oh.. also.. it's very confortable the type. Yes.. separated keys, good mousepad.Release the keyboard: just press the middle buttom and take away the tablet. Recommendation: go to the USB disconnect and safe option, as any other USB pendrive.HDMIDidn't get my HDMI cable! Just didn't come on the box. But, had another from an old cell (the Motorola XT860) and will test it soon.WEIGHTSeparatly, the tablet it's very light.. as any other similar 10 inch tablet. And.. sure.. the battery lasts more (be aware: the keyboard does not have it own battery and only one USB 3.0 port). But together (plus keyboard) it's pretty good. A woman could take it on her purse and woundn't bother.MICRO SDSupports up to 64gb microsd card (had one). Could be protected perhaps, but well, just insert it by the right side and done!CAMERAFront camera, OK for Skype. And agreed: not having rare camera it's not good!BATTERY CHARGEDon't know about other users, but when I went off because the battery was empty,1) just plugged in to the wall and went online (no waiting at all).2) at midnight, 00.00 o'clock left charging (turned off) and this morning at 7.50 am was fully charged.OTG (on the go) CABLEAs any other tablet, when I was using the KEYBOARD USB 3.0 with my external HDD, I plugged the mouse to the tablet using an OTG cable (USB female one side and MICRO USB on the other side) and done!Well.. I think that you will finde very helpful this review because I wrote all the things that I was searching for before buying some tablet/netbook. I'am an Android S.O fun.. I have a Samsung S3 (soon the S4 or S5) and I don't regret the fact of not having a tablet with Android S.O. because all software that I use day by day on a full NOTEBOOK won't find it on Android apps.I mean, yes.. you have the VLC.. but the Corel? The old windows desk friend? Like the Android on my cell, want the Windows 8.1 full on my computer (Windows 7 would be better! hehehe).have fun, go for it!!</td>\n",

One of the big advantages of an iPad is the range of Apple and 3rd party accessories that increase its usefulness.

       "258      I have tried the IPad, the Kindle, and the Sony, and nothing has worked better than this Nook Tablet. It's light, the screen resolution is amazing for movies, and the applications I use work beautifully. Even the speakers are excellent for what they are. No complaints at all.

       "291      I bought the Nook primarily for reading but wanted the HD for email and web browsing also. I was pleasantly surprised at the exceptional screen quality and ease of setup.I did not want to spend the money for an IPAD and now I am glad I didn't as I prefer the Nook interface for reading. The screen brightness can be changed anytime during reading but on the IPAD you have to go into settings after exiting the book you are reading. The only downside is there are not as many apps written for the Nook. I am hoping that will change.

       "307      If you buy this from a B&N; store, and are a member of B&N;, you can get this for $174, which is cheaper than the 8 gig Fire. If you already are loaded with Kindle books, B&N; foolishly doesn't have a Kindle app, but you can, on Amazon or n2a.com buy an n2a card which allows you to boot your Nook up as a full Android complete with access to the Android Market (or whatever Google is calling it now), and get the Kindle app to accress all your Kindle books.  Since I love the design of the eReader  on the Nook, I use my n2a card only when I want a Kindle book.  I find the B&N; Nook books are usually the same price as Kindle.  Occasionally, Kindle doesn't have a book I want but Nook does.  Also, Nook may not have a book Kindle has.  Also, Nook books have the page perfect series, as well as Enhanced Editions with embedded videos and audio clips, neither of which Kindle has.The Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can drag things from your PC to the Nook.  If you want more space for your stuff, you can get any sized san disk for the Nook.  I have a 32 gb one because I transferred about 4,000 pictures to my Nook and am using an app to edit the pictures and then make slide shows of them. Then I'll drag the shows back onto my computer and burn them to disc. Did I mention the Nook is a joy to use? I actually got thre 16gig Tablet but the 8 gig is as fast and has the 11 1/2 hour battery as well as allows the same cards to be added.

       "321      This nook has a very nice format and is very easy to operate and view.  The only draw back is the Battery life is terrible.  I am charging this unit twice a day.  My former Simple Touch only needed charging once a month &#34;with the wifi ON&#34; all the time.  I would NOT recommend this product.

       "345      When I first heard about e-book readers, I was skeptical and did not want to give up my precious collection of books. (I have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me!) But then I finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night, and due to being away from home for periods of time where I couldn't easily carry a dozen books with me.The first reader I had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin' Kindle DS readers with the full key pad. I was excited about that one, but the price was WAY out of range. I decided to try and go with the Nook (after my typical pre-purchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option) and I was so thrilled with it, I had nothing bad to say. I used that little beauty for a few good years, until I was forced to sell it to help pay bills. From the very moment the Nook left my hands I regretted it. I was certain I'd never find one that good again. And I don't believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still!Fast-forward to this Black Friday. The FIRST Black Friday when I actually HAVE some money to spend! And I am looking for a really good e-reader! I did come across the Nook on Amazon, and saw the new Nook Simple Touch, which intrigued me, because I wanted to stick with the e-ink display, and not have a full-size touch screen battery killer. Finally, I realized my love for the original Nook had never died, and it still had everything I could ever want in an e-book reader. I was even able to buy one from a vendor here on Amazon, who lived less than half an hour away from me, and it only cost me $50!!! I was SOOOOO excited!!Now, if only I had NOT wasted $5 on that stupid fake-leather black cover, that completely RUINED the casing on my Nook... :(

       "346      High Points:-Easy to read screen-Touchscreen responsive-Love the physical page turning keys on either side (wish the NookColor had this feature)-Size (can hold it easily in one hand)-Lots of Free Classic Books and Classic Books available for 99 cents-Easily transfer books from your library from device to device (any Nook device or device with a Nook App)-Very organized library (and easy to pick up where you left off no matter how long the Nook has been turned off)-Beautiful design & feels very sturdy and well made-Great accessories-Battery Life (charge lasts about 10 days if you have it on with the internet off for a few hours everyday-MUCH better than the NookColor which gets about 3 days with comparable usage)-eLend compatible with your local library if they offer that feature (which is the only reason I chose this over the Kindle)-Free Updates (as the software improves, you won't have to buy a new device to get the upgrades, like faster page turning, better internet experience, etc)-Free eBook Fridays via the Barnes & Noble storeLower Points:-Delay between turning the page (not a deal breaker by any means but there is a flash everytime you turn the page, which I personally don't like)-Weight (you get used to it, but it could be lighter)-Browsing the internet and playing games via the tiny touchscreen is cumbersome. Not to mention the internet function is quite basic and everything is of course in einkConclusion:If you don't have to have a color screen or a touchscreen and just want an eReader, I think this is a great choice. I love some of the features on this and think they should have been on the NookColor. I definitely read a lot more books now and it's easy to take with me everywhere I go.

       "356      This is a pretty nice looking toy but useless for any real application. No matter how hard I try I just can't force myself to try and read a book on the little 3\" by 5\" screen. The display is small, dim and has poor contrast so it's hard to read unless it's in bright sunlight and pictures on a page are too small to see clearly. It won't play very many types of books besides pdf files and Kindle books are not compatible. Also it goes to sleep if you don't keep constantly moving your finger around on it. Also it's supposed to be able to browse the web but the Web function doesn't do anything but show a Picture of a web page that talks about it's features but if that did work it would be useless since there's no mouse and no way to move around on the page. It can play MP3's that sound ok but it's 100's of times bigger than an iPod and too large to carry around.

       "366      I have been working on my fiction writing skills, and wanted an eBook reader so that I could read a variety of other novels to learn from them.  The Kindle is a great device, but I really wanted a color screen.  The iPad would have been a nice option, but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large.  The myriad Android tablets on the market don't seem to get great reviews, though I suspect that will start to change once Android 3.0 is available.The Nook Color was a nice alternative.  Priced a little higher than some of the no-name Asian tablets, but far less than the iPad.  It supports multi-touch, has a decent color display, and the ability to insert micro SD cards into a slot near the \"loop\" on the bottom.Because it supports both ePub and PDF out of the box, you can find a nice selection of books to download (legally) on the web and read on the device without additional investment.  The Barnes and Noble site also offers a limited, but growing, selection of electronic books (both free and for-a-price).  If you get tired of reading, you can use the built-in WiFi and browser to surf the web.  You can also play a couple of the built-in games, with the promise of more coming in a future update from Barnes and Noble.My only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive, the micro-USB connector is a non-standard type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable.  The connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable, which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while it's charging.Apart from that, battery life has been really good.  I rarely have to plug it in before I am finished reading for the day.The built-in web browser works well, displaying pretty much any web site that an iPad or Android phone can handle.The WiFi seems to find and hold on to signals well, and I don't recall it dropping a connection so far.If you take the time to learn how to \"root\" the device, you can add the Android Market to it and many apps (like the Kindle app) work very nicely on it.  This gives you the best of both worlds in a sense... The ability to buy eBooks from Amazon and Barnes and Noble, while keeping your color display.As far as eye strain goes, I work at computers 8 or more hours a day on the job and more when I get home.  I find the Nook's display easy to read for hours at a time and don't feel that my eyes are any more strained than when I read a printed paper book.  But your mileage may vary.  If e-Ink works better for you, the Kindle is a great alternative.I like the ability to highlight parts of the books I'm reading, take notes inside the book as I read (e.g., to highlight particularly good dialogue, characterization, description, etc., as a writer), and to post updates to Twitter and Facebook about your progress through a book.All in all, this was my favorite 2010 Christmas gift and has (for me) eliminated any desire to own an iPad or any other eBook reader.

       "369      I bought this product used from a coworker's daughter who was phenomenally underwhelmed by it. It is heavy and slippery. The capacitive touch is not perfect, and the narrow metal rim of the screen ensures one ends up touching the screen and changing things inadvertently. There is only one option for a page turn; lefties beware. The battery life is far shorter than the time necessary to read a medium length book, and the plug-in is at the bottom of the unit. Since the cable is specific to the NC, I hated to risk bending/breaking it as I can imagine it is pricey to replace so plugging in the unit usually meant it was time to put the unit down for a LONG time while it recharged. I traveled with this unit, and it did not get me from one airport to the next on a charge. A lot of the ebooks I own are in .pdb format, which B&N sells, but the NC does not read. I was having problems with the unit not doing the motion side-turn and read thingy, and B&N pretty well ignored me. The local manager reminded me that used units are no longer subject to help. (The concept of the unit being less than 4 months old when it died, and turned on twice before I bought it, didn't bear any weight.) A local computer repair guy charged me $60 for absolutely no help at all; apparently the NC is far too complicated for anyone but a B&N repair person which never bodes well. Now the unit, fully charged, will not turn on at all; again, no help at the forum. Since for $40 more one can buy a ViewSonic gTablet with 10\" Multi-Touch LCD Screen, Android OS 2.2 and download reading apps for it, I'd say forget the Nook Color.

       "373      I am the occasional reader but, I bought this for tablet capability.  It can be rooted in about 2 minutes to have app store.  Once that is done, You can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering B&N; store.  It's still there but, not right in my face. Default browser is OK  but, I prefer Dolphin HD.  It's much more than half and Ipad at exactly half the price.  Plus, when used as a reader, it's just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose.  I had a Pandigital novel that I got for Xmas that completely died in 3 weeks.  I took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that I can remember making:  The Nook Color.  The novel is pure garbage compared to this device.  Android 2.1 is so much better than 1.6.  I also couldn't get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything. Spend the extra $ and get the color.  Save the extra money from the Ipad. I was considering Archos 70 but, I couldn't find anywhere to actually play with it.  Plus, given their history; I had decided against it.Good:Nice screen,  capacitive touch,  strong wifi, decent battery life, Nice CPU @ 800 MHz,  512 MB RAM  Ipad only has 256  supposedly), Tons of free apps available, very reasonably priced,  portable,  Barnes and Noble magazines  very reasonably priced at $1 to $3 an issue), microsd slot.Bad  minor complaints):that silly plastic thing in the corner, mono speaker, micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot, doesn't come with android market.Overall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a while.UPDATE.  Couple of small annoyances: randomly reboots instead of sleeping, wireless doesn't come back up sometimes after rebooting.  Still very happy with it though. Sleep issue apparently also happens to those who haven't rooted.  I'm sure it will be fixed with update.UPDATE:  I am very unhappy with Barnes and Noble's many attempts to update my firmware without my permission.  They have tried twice and didn't succeed.  I believe that AVG antivirus is stopping it.  They got my girlfriend's and we have the same nook, that came with same firmware, that was flashed with same mod.  The only thing I can think of was AVG must have stopped it.  They got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine.  She wasn't running AVG and mine was.  It's the only thing I can think of.Who else does that?  I have items from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, HTC (Sprint), etc and NONE of them update my property.  Who do these people think they are? Well, they won't be updating my firmware and now I won't be buying books from them either.  Anyway, it's an aging piece of hardware and now for a bit more money something better can be bought.Side Note:  I had ordered a touchpad from B&N; back on AUgust 21st.  Not only did I not get one, they cancelled my order for me without so much as an email.  Not very nice.

       "381      I have had my Nook for 5 months and the only issue I have had with it is the charger cord went bad, but I called the toll free number and they are sending me a new one for free.

       "411      Last year my husband asked me if I wanted a Kindle, because I love to read all the time and I try to be eco-friendly when possible.  I was intrigued, but my biggest weakness is magazines and I didn't like the availability or look of them on the Kindle.  When the iPad came out, I was blown away by the beauty of it, but felt like for a few dollars more I could just get a whole new laptop and it would be almost the same size.  For travel, the iPad seemed to big and fragile for me; I need to be able to jam all my toys into my backpack and not worry about them.When I stumbled onto the Nook Color, I absolutely flipped my wig and couldn't wait to get one!  Full color magazines, that look just like they do on the newsstand!  This could single-handedly save the rain forests - I seriously buy a LOT of magazines.  I also save them forever because you never know when you might want that one article or photo again, which drives my husband crazy.  So perhaps the Nook Color can save my marriage as well!  That's a lot of expectation to put on this adorable little device, but I think it's up to the challenge.Santa decided to come early to our house, so I just started playing with the NC a few days ago, and it is my first e-reader.  It was almost fully charged right out of the box, so I was able to start playing with it in less than an hour (it says you can use it while it is plugged in, but they keypad is VERY oversensitive when plugged in so I don't recommend it).  It easily connected to my home wifi and linked to the Barnes & Noble account I had set up earlier that day.  If you don't have home wifi, you might have to visit a public wifi location in order to activate it.  I recommend setting up a B&N; account beforehand if you intend to purchase anything from there, as it makes the first-time Nook use very smooth and enjoyable.BOOKS: There are many many books available from a variety of online sources, check the product details for formats (please note it does NOT support Kindle format).  I understand it's also easy to download books from your local public library, though I haven't tried that yet.  The B&N; Shop function within the Nook itself is the easiest interface but certainly not the only option.  While reading, it's very easy to adjust the font, screen brightness, and more to make it as comfortable as possible on the eyes.  At night I turn the brightness all the way down and find it very comfortable for my eyes while reading in bed.  I've read for hours on end without any sort of headache.  I haven't used the highlight, look-up, or share functions very much yet, but they're super easy to incorporate if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Page turning is an intuitive flip of the finger, or you can tap the side of the screen to move forward or back.CHILDREN'S BOOKS: The color on these looks amazing, and the \"read to me\" feature is wonderful for little ones learning to read on their own.  I imagine this would be great fun for a kid stuck in the back seat of a car for a long trip too!  There aren't a ton of Read to Me books available yet but they are adding more every week.  I don't even have kids but these are pretty awesome.MAGAZINES: Obviously this was a major feature for me!  The appearance of the magazines is absolutely gorgeous, the text and photos are clear and sharp.  You can use the \"finger pinch\" method on the touchscreen to zoom in and out, or you can use the \"Article View\" feature to pull out just the text of each page at a pleasant reading size.  The magazine includes every single page that you'd find on the newsstand, including advertisements, which to me is a benefit because I sometimes enjoy the photography and trends those provide.  Magazines can be read in portrait or landscape format, and you can flip through thumbnails at the bottom of the page to reach a particular article.  Most of the currently available magazines offer a single-issue purchase or a 14-day free trial, then bill you monthly for as long as you want to receive issues.  Subscriptions are very easy to manage so canceling is not complicated.  So far there are about 80 magazines available, and the number seems to be increasing regularly.NEWSPAPERS and PDF's: I haven't tried these yet, though some have reported formatting that make certain ones difficult to read.  The ones purchased directly through the Nook store are more likely to be formatted appropriately for the device and easier to read.  Better PDF support is likely to come in a future firmware update, though a lot of it depends on how the original publisher sets up the file.INTERNET: You do need a wifi connection to go online; 3G is unlikely to be available for the Nook Color unless you also purchase an accompanying data plan.  So far most web pages look crisp and beautiful, but are not as fully functional as on a laptop or computer.  Flash functionality is not available yet (but is planned) and a lot of people are experiencing difficulty with email and other text box typing.  I believe this will be fixed very soon, but for now the web is more of a \"read-only\" experience.MUSIC: You can load your own music or use the included Pandora app to link to your Pandora account.  The speaker isn't great so headphones would come in handy.  I'm extremely in love with my new iPod Nano so I will probably strap that on while reading rather than use this feature.VIDEO: Our first try produced some choppy playback, but I think the processor was very busy setting up the hardware because we had just gotten it out of the box.  After that, it played everything perfectly with jaw-dropping video quality!  It will play videos in MP4 format, so get yourself a converter and a microSD card and load it up for your next trip!  Apparently videos can also be side-loaded through the mini-USB cord.  I've only tried it on the card; it reads directly from the card with no problems.OTHER: You can add your own photos to use as background, or just to show friends.  It comes pre-loaded with a few games (sudoku, crossword, and chess) which work well and are fun.  \"Lend Me\" is an exclusive feature that allows you to swap books with other Nook users, and you can find groups of folks online who will swap with you if none of your friends have a Nook.  It uses the android operating system, and an app store is scheduled to open sometime in early 2011 so there will be much much more available in the coming months.I'm the type of person who doesn't need my phone to be a camera, my iPod to be a dvd player, or my e-reader to be a laptop.  The Nook Color does a WONDERFUL job as an e-reader of not only books, but also magazines and newspapers, and it has some other fun bells and whistles.  It does what it's supposed to do very well and the additional features make it a great value for the price.  I would give it a million stars if I could!

       "565      I'll admit up front that when I chose the Nook over Kindle and Sony's e-reader, I was impressed by that nifty full color touchscreen at the bottom of reading screen.  Glitz does not equal function, as I promptly found out.To be fair to Nook, if ALL you want to do is read, the device works, and works pleasantly.  I received my Nook in February, so it had the latest firmware updates, and I experienced none of the delays in downloading, missed sections of books, delays in page turning that early reports noted.  But if I was attempting to do anything more than clicking the page turning buttons, OUCH!The nifty little full color touchscreen (NOT to be confused with the e-paper reading screen, which is permanently gray-scale) just can't do it's job.  It responds slowly and inconsistently to touch, is quirky in its response, and virtually (no pun intended) unusable.  The virtual keyboard:  what a nightmare.  It's a true challenge to type more than one or two words without making an error, and trying to fix that error degenerates into a tragi-comedy in short order.The unit itself is pleasant to the hand, and comfortable.  It's also darn slick in its appearance, and if aesthetics  are your only criteria, well, go for it.  But here is why I returned the Nook after one week:  any optional feature, such as bookmarking, highlighting text and annotating it, search functions for previous book marks and annotations:  purely a nightmare.  The processor of the Nook appears to be vastly underpowered, and each instruction you give the touchscreen results in a wait that seems interminable.  It took me 30 seconds, AFTER I got good at it, to highlight 3 lines at the bottom of a page.  Simply not acceptable.Battery life:  might have just been my own unit, but in 7 hours: dead.  I also experienced two full scale lockups, with all buttons simply refusing to work for several minutes.The Nook's only advantage, as far as I can tell, is access to significantly more free content than you can currently access on Kindle.  Not worth the incredible frustration of wrestling with a device that went for touchscreen technology, but forgot that the touchscreen needs to be FUNCTIONAL before you bring it to market.Update as of 2/11/2010:  I purchased a Kindle after returning my Nook, and have been using it for three days.  Wow.  What an incredible difference in terms of ease of use.  The keyboard is very functional, bookmarking and note taking is effortless, the dictionary function (move the cursor to a word, instantly a definition pops up) is wonderful. Battery consumption is imperceptible, after 3 day, no visible drain (my Nook lasted 7 hours).  Downside of the Kindle?  Books whose copyright had expired (e.g. Wuthering Heights)that were FREE on Nook, are 99 cents on Kindle.  Nook lists all vendors of a given book, with prices conveniently visible, Kindle does not.  Irritating.  Lastly, Nook had a tiny clock in a corner of the screen, which I found very useful.  Not available on Kindle.  Overall:  for my needs, no contest whatsoever: Kindle

       "8465     I'm not a gamer, music lover or have any huge need for an expensive pair of stereo headphones. I just want to experience decent sound from lightweight headphones when watching movies on my tablet.  That's what I get with Panasonic's RP-HT21. Nice bass sound without a tinny treble. Good price.

       "48385    These are the best headphones I've owned to date. They sound absolutely superb. You hear everything crystal clear with these. And for the price, just under $50 dollars, makes them all the more worth it to buy these. I've used them just for home use, i.e. using them for my iPod, computer, tablet, etc. For some odd reason, they don't sound AS good with my iPod than they do with my computer, but nonetheless they still sound great. Also the materials that these were made of feel good, look good, and are very durable. The headband and earpads are extremely comfortably. The cord is thick and conveniently long.I'd most definitely recommend these to anyone.

       "55002    EP 121 Users: this is a 100% compatible replacement for original ASUS SLATE stylus. Even replacement tips are identical to ones coming with original stylus! It adds more functionality with pen button (switch). The catch: it does not fit ANYWAY in tablet's pen slot but only if inserted with the switch facing the rear of the tablet (opposite the touch screen). Looks, feels and works the same as the original. GREAT PRODUCT!

       "59635    These are great little \"disposable\" headphones.  If you have young kids like I do, you know they are always loosing/sitting on/allowing dog to chew up things like headphones.  Mine use them for their Kindle Fires ans well as their MP3 players...all the time.  At this price, I keep a spare set in all the vehicles and four sets at home.

       "78798    I am very pleased with this tripod.  Works great, rugged, light, and fairly small in length.  I carry it on the side of my camera backpack for occasions when I don't want to lug around my full size tripod.  There's cheaper tabletop tripods on the market, but sometimes you get what you pay for.  Well worth the $30 I paid for it.

       "79148    IMPORTANT UPDATE ON 3-24-14: This post is kind of backwards but I would rather not re-write it.  Essentially, if the package comes with a driver disc, use that first.  You may have to set it for compatibility mode for Win 2000 or XP and maybe run the installation disc as an administrator as well.  If that doesn't work well or is buggy, see [1~ below.Create a Restore Point using the \"System\" icon then \"System Protection\" in the Control Panel before attempting this.Wacom does not supply a driver for this unit for Windows 7 if you search the list, including legacy drivers, at their website.  I did, however, find a driver which I installed today on my new computer and it's working great so far.  This is the name of the driver file:  (Wacom) cons521-6a_int.exe which can be found as of today, here:  http://www.wacom.eu/index4.asp?pid=29&list;=allNow, if you have Win 7 and plug in your Tablet, the computer will probably (as it did on mine) install a generic driver which does allow the tablet, stylus and mouse to work but it does not include a user interface for setting the fine adjustments of the devices.  Practically useless.  You can install the disc if this package comes with one and see how that goes.[1~ If you have problems though, I would uninstall the drivers and the DEVICE and then RESTORE THE COMPUTER to your last restore point.]When that's done, install the file above, shut the computer down, cut all power to the computer or pull out the power cord to flush recent memory, plug in the tablet with the power still off and then restart the computer.You will be able to access the GUI for the tablet from the CONTROL PANEL since no icon is present in the system tray for easy access.  You will see an icon called \"Pen Tablet Properties\".  Do not use \"Pen and Touch\".If you want to incorporate \"swipes\" because you have a touch screen, I'm afraid you're on your own.  I don't have one.  The \"Pen and Touch\" interface includes that feature but it may conflict with the other GUI's settings.  Use your own judgement.This tablet, pen and mouse set is still working great for me.  I need to mention that it does NOT require batteries.  The tablet plugs into your USB port and that's it.  The pen and mouse are sensed by the tablet and never need batteries.  The driver software allows for easy switching from \"What you see is what you get\" pointing to old-fashioned regular mouse behavior on the fly.  That is, if you prefer to surf the Web with the mouse set on a fast speed to get you across your monitor faster, you can easily switch it over then back again for drawing or editing images.Here's how to set it up:  Go to the Pen Tablet Properties GUI.  Set one of your pen's two buttons to activate \"Pop up window\" which will show a pop up menu on the screen when you press it.  Go to the Pop up menu tab at the top.  Choose from the drop down list \"Pen mode\" and then \"Mouse mode\".  Do the same for the Mouse.  I used the wheel \"click\" for the pop up menu assignment since I've never used it for anything else.  Now you will be able to switch between the two modes (assuming you've set them up with different parameters) by pressing the button for the pop up menu and clicking your choice.Questions?  Comment me.ORIGINAL POST:I bought this a few years ago so I don't know about availability of drivers.  Check with the company first to make sure it's compatible with your pc or mac.  I do all kinds of art work and this product is indispensable for doing anything which requires multiple strokes with a mouse.  Also much more accurate than a mouse for doing photo retouching or anything where fine detail is important.  You may think you're pretty good with a mouse and don't need this but I can promise you that once you start working with one you will be addicted.  I have done some serious work with this model and you don't need to spend more unless you are a professional.  The pressure sensitivity levels are more than adequate for me.

       "81866    There are some negative reviews here -- please, before posting, read all the comments. If you're upset this does not have the range/power you want \"out of the box\" then write to your Congressman and ask them to relax limits the FCC places on these devices. Or \"open the box\" and tweak the master volume knob. Just know there IS a legal cap on performance for any consumer FM transmitter, and it is ignorant to blame the manufacturer. All transmitters are subject to this rule, and this one is unique because you can override that setting (at your own risk).This device is unique because you can:a) choose ANY frequency (not just 2 or 3 set at the factory)But your results will vary by frequency. You MUST research what stations are used in your area, and find some \"dead space\" between channels. This sweet spot will vary if you are mobile between home and work, for example.In my area, the default station 88.3 has a strong public radio station, so I found 90.5 worked best. There are websites that will show you station strength and distance based on your postal code... they help. Don't expect to get a good signal on a thin slice between 2 strong stations.b) You can \"boost\" device power using the internal screw (VR2) trick documentd here. It works. Just don't turn it up more than you need... maxing it out can easily interfere with radio reception on or near your frequency choice. If everyone on your street can't tune in a valid station, you are asking for trouble from the FCC.As a new owner, I should add the following about the disassembly:Notice the \"volume wheel\" that protrudes through the case? That can easily snap off during disassembly. It's almost impossible to remove the cover without putting SOME stress on the wheel (a little bit does not break it but YMMV). At the very least, first make sure this wheel is at MAX (so IF it breaks off, maybe it's just stuck on max boost).Near the antenna, they use some gummy glue to hold the case together. Just carefully pry the case apart. To avoid losing control during this step and stressing wires, I used a wide flat screwdriver and twisted it (providing just enough separation force to pop the glue on that side).This was easier than it sounds, but if you are clumsy with a screwdriver then get someone to do it for you... or skip this type of device, and get a long audio extension cable.Works on any headphone port, such as my

       "100797   This is a great little travel bag for compact video or digital cameras. Just enough room for the camera and a battery charger. Several pockets hold memory cards and batteries as well as a slim tabletop tripod. Very convenient size and weight that makes it perfect for walking tours, etc. An SLR and lens would be a very tight fit if possible at all.

       "1678995  The BDP-S6200 lives at the top of Sony's North American bluray players range for 2014. This player is essentially a replacement to the well liked 2012 BDP-S790Sony BDPS790 3D Blu-ray Player with Wi-Fiwith a few features removed, but a few features added. More on that in a moment.The player keeps the familiar XMB (Cross Media Bar) interface just like its previous players. Its functional but I can't help feel its days are numbered since Sony has done away with it on their TV range. You can choose to start the player in the Sony Entertainment Network portal if you wish ... but it really doesn't offer you anything different from starting the player normally within the XMB.This top player gets a dual core processor (like the BDP-S790) so disks load fast and app navigation is zippy. A good test is to use the Youtube app that seems pretty CPU intensive. You can normally weed out under performers with that app .... but the BDP-S6200 handles YouTube very well.App support is solid enough, with new a new Crackle app that supports Crackle favorites. There is a new Hulu app too, but that was released across last years players too. The player also sees the new Netflix interface which is very nice too.The player also features a new Amazon App for 2014. It's certainly more visual than the older one but I think it's going to take a few software updates to get it tweaked just right.The player also has the Opera TV store with a bunch of apps in that too ... so you should be well supported for apps. Note, often asked but there is no HBO Go app on this player.The player itself, I think looks very stylish ... however if you are looking for more conservative styling, you may want to pick up a older BDP-S790. It doesn't seem as solid as the older BDP-S790 ... but it seems many mass market electronic manufacturers are heading in this direction as a whole, so I'm not really surprised here.Please note though, that despite Amazon's or Sony product description, there is only 1 HDMI output on the player !!Now, if you already own a 2013 x100 player from Sony, such as the BDP-5100Sony BDP-S5100 3D Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi, what does this new player offer?You will get the benefit of Super bit mapping (SBM) which improves color banding evident on internet video, improved DVD upscaling with additional levels of picture adjustment, IP Noise reduction pro for internet video, new audio enhancer, the new Netflix app, a new Crackle app and maybe a new Amazon app once it comes on line.For 2012 owners that have the BDP-S790, upgrading to a BDP-S6200 they get the benefit of the new audio enhancer, the new netflix app (with 5800kbps support), a new Crackle app and maybe a new Amazon app. They also get improved codec support in MKVs with MPEG2 and VC-1 video codecs. If they have a 2013 or above Sony TV, and appropriate BD media, they can take advantage of extended color (Triluminos). They also get screen mirroring with Android phone and tablets.They loose the extra HDMI output, Skype support and arguably less solid build.Again the player does not include a HDMI cable so buyer be pre-warned. Also, as with new bluray players, there is no analog outputs on the player so you're TV must support HDMI. There is a digital coaxial output for receivers that dont support HDMI for audio.If you do buy one of these and can't figure out how to get HD audio (DTS-MA or Dolby TrueHD) output from the player be sure to switch off BD-Audio mix AND the audio enhancer in the audio settings.Overall, its another solid Bluray player from Sony with some marginal improvements over last years player ... but nothing earth shattering. Recommended.Thanks for reading.- update 3/22/14The new Amazon App is now up and running, as is VUDU on the BDP-S6200. You will need to download a firmware update to enable these apps.

       "1679396  Powerbanks are usually not what I&#8217;d describe as &#8220;fun&#8221; things to play with, but this one comes pretty close mainly due to it&#8217;s novel way to display the remaining charge: you give the powerbank a shake, and the LED gas gauge lights up (1 to 4 lights that indicate charge level). It takes a conventional feature and makes it a bit fun to use.It also handles the practical basics very well. The overall design is well thought-out, with attached cables for micro USB and Lightning connections. That&#8217;s a very helpful feature since I&#8217;m always forgetting to bring cables along. This ensures you won&#8217;t be left high and dry for lack of a cable.The build quality is solid, with tight seams and well-anchored ports. Visually it looks nice as well, with an all-black case with bright red attached cables. It&#8217;s flat on the base and stands up on all sides without any wobble.The 8400mAh rating is more than adequate for a couple of phone recharges or a full tablet recharge. It&#8217;s not the highest capacity out there, but the size/performance is a nice middle ground &#8211; this measures about 2.5 inches wide and 4.5 inches tall, making it pretty easy to take along.Zero complaints about performance, and appreciate the thoughtful design (and the ability to shake it!).

       "1679858  I live in a large, 2-story house with a basement. My modem and wireless router is on the first floor on one end of the house and I notice that signal strength is diminished on the second floor at the other end of the house. It is also very poor in the basement. I was really excited to have the opportunity to try this range extender (also sometimes called a repeater)  from TP-Link.So when you open the box, you find the Powerline Adapter, the Wifi Extender (the larger brick), and ethernet cable, a resource CD and a Quick Installation Guide. The Quick Installation Guide can be a little confusing for non-technical people so I will outline exactly what I did to set up the extender using the Wifi Clone feature, which is the simplest and fastest method.You need to be certain that your wireless router is WPS enabled. If it is, there will be a button with a special WPS symbol on it or above it. Your router doesn't need to be TP-Link brand. I have a Linksys e4200 and it worked perfectly. Then follow these steps:1) Plug the Wifi Extender (the larger brick that says Wifi AV-500 on it) into an electrical outlet near your wireless router. NOTE: It cannot be a power strip - only a regular, built-in electrical outlet.2) Press the WPS button on your router for 2 seconds (no longer)3) Press the Wifi Clone button on the Wifi Extender for 2 seconds (no longer). It's at the bottom of the row of lights on the front of the extender - it's a little hard to see. Note: It is NOT the reset button located near the two ethernet ports on one end of the extender. The Wifi Clone button will blink slowly for about 20 seconds, then all the lights will be on for a moment, then the Wifi Clone button will begin blinking quickly, which tell you the cloning process is complete. It is now set up on your wireless network.4) Now plug one end of the ethernet cable included into your wireless router.5) Plug the other end of the ethernet cable into the Powerline Adapter and then plug that into an electrical outlet.6) Now you can move the Wifi Extender (the larger brick) to an electrical outlet in any area of your home that has poor wifi strength and you're done! NOTE: Again, you cannot use a power strip - only a regular, built-in electrical outlet.This process clones your current wireless network so all of your devices will simply log into your network as usual, but with much better reception. Additionally, you can add up to 7 additional Wifi Extenders to strengthen reception in very large areas or homes with multiple floors. I have ordered another of these kits, since at the current price of ~$58 it is less expensive than just ordering a single extender, to place in the basement so I will have better reception there, too.You will notice that there are 2 ethernet ports on the bottom of the Extender. Those are for devices that do not have wireless capabilities.If your wireless router doesn't feature WPS, you can also configure it manually through a web application. You can also build a new wifi network with this kit. The directions are included in the user's manual found on the resource CD or (my preference) download the full users manual at tp-link dot com.This has worked flawlessly for me. I do have occasional internet drop-outs but I had those long before I got this kit. (I suspect it is my ISP.) My son can now stream Netflix to his Kindle in his bedroom whereas before, there wasn't enough signal strength to do so. In the room furthest from the router on the second floor, we can now watch streaming video without the constant, annoying buffering.Also at tp-link dot com, you will find a firmware upgrade. Look on the bottom of the Wifi Extender for the version number and if you have V:1.0, the firmware upgrade is for you. You will download the upgrade to your computer and then follow the directions for installation. Note: TP-Link recommends disconnecting from the internet before performing the firmware upgrade and I agree. Simply unplug the ethernet cable that connects your wireless router to your modem before upgrading. Once the upgrade is complete, plug the cable back into your wireless router and you're done.Because there are so many variables with regard to wireless routers, electrical wiring, house configuration, etc., I am not surprised to see that this product did not work perfectly for every reviewer. However, if you buy from Amazon, you can easily return it for a full refund if it doesn't work for you. I'm very, very pleased my increased wifi signal strength upstairs.

       "1679893  With so many households hosting multiple devices that need charging on a regular basis, companies are now stepping up to the plate and offering 4-port USB-chargers. I've often been known to have several devices plugged in overnight to every available receptacle, including those on my PC USB ports. If I'm in need of a rapid charge during the day, I much prefer the AC method of charging.Immediately when plugged in the Arctic indicates it's ready to power up with a blue LED light in the center of the device. The fast charge ports for devices that draw a heavier load such as tablets, the iPhone, and iPads are indicated by orange. They are stacked on one side of the Arctic and the other fast charge ports are beside them.On the interface of the device are LED status indicators that show that the individual USB ports are receiving power. For something like the iPad this is rather an extraneous feature because I do know when my iPad is receiving an initial power influx because I can hear a blink and can see not only a battery indicating my charge, but also the charging icon in the upper right-hand corner.FEATURES:&#9658; 4.5Amp Total Output Ideal for Charging Tablet/Smartphone/e-Reader/MP3&#9658; 4-USB Ports with Fast-Charge Capabilities, 2 Dedicated Tablet Fast-Charge Ports&#9658; Dedicated LED Charge Indicator for Each Port&#9658; Overload Safety Protection on Each Port Protecting Charging Devices&#9658; US Plug. 2-Year Limited WarrantySPECS:~&#9658; Input AC 100V x 240V 50/60Hz~&#9658; Output DC 5V x 4000mA~&#9658; Weight 3.5 ounces (99.2233g)~&#9658; Power: 20W~&#9658; LED indication: Mono Orange, Blue~&#9658; Safety approval: CE, RoHsDimensions:&#9658; Body only: 1.06&#34;(H) x 2.08&#34; (W) x 2.95&#34; (L); 27 (H) x 53 (W) x 75 (L) mm&#9658; With plug: 1.88&#34; (H) x 2.08&#34; (W) x 2.95&#34; (L); 48 (H) x 53 (W) x 75 (L) mmINDIVIDUAL LED INDICATORS / STATUS:&#9658; Slow Flashing: Charging output below 1000mA&#9658; LED on: Charging output between 1100mA and 2000mA&#9658; Fast Flashing: Charging output above 2000mA&#9658; No LED: No devices plugged in or charge complete (&#60;90% power)The Arctic charges quite well as expected, however there were a few things I would have either liked to see or preferred. I much prefer flip-down AC prongs, specifically for travel. The lack of them makes the Arctic better suited for home use only. At that, one should keep in mind that holding on to the box it came in will be preferable for storage.Not intuitive. Unless you have the small one sheet user manual, anyone else using the Arctic Home Charger may not realize which port is for tablets or iPads or other devices. I much prefer my USB ports to be labeled 2.1A and 1.0A. I've had some chargers that have dedicated ports for specific devices, but the Arctic doesn't designate to the user which ports are optimal the home user. Excellent charger, but could be better with the addition of flip-down prongs and port labeling.Sample provided for review.

       "1680509  Fantastic little tablet and does what it needs to do.32gb I got by accident, thinking I had bought the 64gb. I didn't realized until I finished setting up my apps and I don't feel like exchanging and starting over so I kept it. Especially after seeing I made it work.You won't be able to install everything you want on here so be wise on how you use the space. I keep NO files on here and just take what I need from Dropbox. For programs, I only have MS Office, a typography app, firefox, Photoshop CC 2014 and Illustrator CC 2014. I uninstalled any crap I wasn't using and if I need to code, I'll do just fine with notepad. I think with all said and done I have about 9gb of hard drive space left. Works for me. I just wanted it for on the go internet and quick drawing and editing.I highly recommend not multitasking when running Photoshop or Illustrator CC 2014. No one anywhere will tell you this okay to do and will try to sell you tablets with 8gb ram. Maybe a rare few will tell you 4gb works just fine. This is running on 2gb ram and it works but multitasking here is a no no. Huge files are also not going to end well. Another thing is that the stylus that comes with this tablet kind of sucks. What I did was buy the microsoft surface pen which also has wacom technology and it works way better.Other things I'd say is it does get finger prints on it very easily so a cover and screen protector is a must if this bothers you. Also I wish the AC adapter was longer. It has a very short cord.Sure knowing this, I could have waited for the surface pro 3 i3 processor coming out soon but this was cheaper even with the accessories I bought in addition to the tablet and does the same thing. Don't get me wrong, SP3 is a might fine device and can potentially do as it says and replace your PC and tablet but this little guy here packs a punch for the price and if you need it for basic, straightforward tasks, this is the one to get.

       "1680557  I purchased this in December from the Microsoft store as their price was several hundred dollars less then Amazon. It is one of the prettiest laptops out there. This touch screen works well, and that is an advantage over any Apple computer product (excluding tablets and cell phone.) I moved up from windows XP to this one, Windows 8.1. Learning the new operating system takes time, but is not difficult. The BIG problem with this computer is it's horrible network adapter, Intel Centrino wireless-n 2230. It works slower than my 1989 2400 baud dial-up modem! After updating its driver, there was absolutely no improvement. A Toshiba software update of 480 MEGAbits took over 8 hours! Now it has to be sent to Toshiba for replacement of the network adapter. I was told that they would likely be wiping my programs & data in the process. That will cost me around 5 hours of time to replace upon its return. This is unacceptable in a 2-month old laptop. I have had computers since 1989, AST Research, Compaq, a previous Toshiba, and Dell. Never before did I have any problem that required a replacement of hardware in less than 4 years of constant usage to the hard drive. Additionally, their customer service reps are not well educated and despite claiming to have 24/7 Platinum Service, they are only available until 7 PM during the week, and are CLOSED every weekend. I wish I could return this, but it's past the 30 days. My next computer will be an Apple. CAVEAT EMPTOR! Buyer beware!

       "1680616  I've had the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 for about a month and it's been nice.  The extra real estate is nice, though it did take some getting used to since my previous tablet was a 10.1&#34; (a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 to be exact).  It's also quite a bit heavier, but it makes it feel solid.  If you travel a lot, I would make sure it isn't too heavy for you.  It weighs as much as some small laptops.  other than that, it's an outstanding tablet.  I'm very happy with it.

       "1680686  All the good reviews are true. The screen is beautiful and the CPU is fast. This works great for downloading photos from my DSLR, cropping them, resizing them and even correcting the color (the display can be color-calibrated) before I forward them onto my boss. I've found two small problems that few will care about but here they are.The Wifi isn't very fast. I rarely get transfers faster than 1MB per second and usually get half of that even three feet from the Wifi router. In the same location my laptop regularly transfers 9-10 MB per second. Copying files through MTP transfers at 3-5 MB per second so that's the way to go if you don't mind plugging in a USB cable.Video and audio acceleration in hardware is missing some important codecs. The most surprising is that AC-3 (better known as Dolby Digital) is not supported. This is the most common audio format used on DVDs and the only format used for high definition television in the U.S. The native video player simply says &#34;Unsupported audio codec&#34; and you get no sound. There is also no hardware acceleration for MPEG-2 video which is the standard format for DVDs and high definition television -- the default video player says &#34;Sorry this video cannot be played&#34;.This means that if you want to drop any file on the tablet and expect it to play, you will need another video player which will support these codecs through software (MX Player plays every file I've thrown at it). If you want to maximize the battery life by using hardware acceleration, you'll need to reencode video from DVDs or HD broadcasts into codecs that are supported by the hardware like AVC and MP3. This is a surprising inconvenience since even my phone supports these in hardware.

       "1680689  I decided to downsize from my previous 10.1&#34; tablet of a different brand as I found it to be too awkward to hold during my commute and the tab pro 8.4 has worked out nicely! The tablet is light, easy to hold with one hand, and the screen is big enough. My needs are fairly simple - I don't use the multi window functionality that Samsung has provided - it does work, but I simply have no need for it. Mostly I use it for browsing the web, processing and posting photos (taken with my 36 mp camera) when travelling, and watching movies. The tab pro 8.4 is pretty snappy while performing/switching between these tasks and the screen - 2560 by 1600 - is the sharpest you can get right now. Absolutely no complaints about any of that. The battery is fair and when I fly long haul I make sure to take an external battery pack with me (mostly for a piece of mind - haven't had to use it yet). The biggest con about this tablet is that it's only available as a 16 gig version. Sure, you can store media on the external microSD card, but when it comes to apps - you will have to prioritize the apps (some games run a few gigs!) that you will have installed. Overall I am pleased with the product.

       "1680721  I have a galaxy Note 3 (upgraded from the Note 1), and so when this came out I upgraded from my Galaxy Note 10.1.  The larger screen is a welcome change, especially using office apps in a pinch.  The screen is gorgeous, the tablet is generally easy to use with the added features using the pen.  It performs quite well and the battery is good for several days of normal use.I wished samsung included a micro usb to standard usb OTG adapter, would make using existing extras easier.  But overall, love this tablet!Would be nice to set Google NOW as one of the home screens, instead of just an app you can access...

       "1680760  This is stunning and even better than my highest expectations.  I also use a 10&#34; Asus and this isn't much heavier or harder to hold.Video: Stunning for watching movies in bed or in a car.  The best bedroom tv is a tablet.Business: Perfect size for a laptop replacement.  This is all I'm bringing for business on trips.Entertainment: mainly for my kids but this is a dream for them.  Quality is ridiculous.Samsung has the best Android interface.Build is very nice and well-done.  Buttons nicely placed.  Great hi-quality speakers.Not sure if the pen is worth it vs the regular galaxy.  I wanted it for sketching but the pressure sensitivity seems hard to control - maybe just a matter of getting used ot it.  I plan on using this a lot for a couple of years so the extra $ was a worthwhile gamble.Bought a Sony 64GB sd card.  Works great.  My only complaint is that Android treats the internal flash mem as special and many apps won't make use of the extra card (Google Music is a big culprit).

       "1680819  I originally bought into the tablet game with the Acer Iconia A510, even though it's creeping up on two years of age, the tablet has aged pretty well. You only really notice slow downs when attempting to watch higher resolution videos or some of the more memory intensive games. I honestly wasn't expecting the Tab Pro to really wow me.I've recently upgraded to a Note 3 phone, and to say that the Tab Pro is a upsized version of my phone is pretty accurate. The aesthetics are almost exactly like the Note 3 body - from the plastic/chromed edging, to the look and feel of the home button. It's also as thin as my phone, which was really the most noticeable change from my Iconia. I didn't think my Iconia was &#34;fat&#34; until I started handling the Tab.Performance-wise, I'm not a super user on my tablet. I generally just watch some you tube videos, stream some off Amazon or netflix, and maybe play a few games from the latest Humble Android Bundle. The Tab's taken everything I've thrown at it and just shrugged it off.If there was a complaint I could level about the Tab, it would be that the touch sensitivity doesn't seem to be quite as accurate as I'd like to be. When pushing the 2560x1600 WQXGA resolution, quite a few of the apps don't scale well and tend to make their various hit boxes for context menus tiny. I'm assuming that having a stylus like the Note series might help negate this issue, on the Tab it makes for a few frustrating instances of &#34;stabbing&#34; the Tab with my finger, trying to make the tablet register that I'm clicking on the tiny [X] box. Now that I've vented, I really can't think of any other issue I've run into with this tablet.

       "1680911  I have both. Here is my thoughts:1. Appearance:SoundLink 3 has a old-timer classic look. The silver part of the box is paint sprayed mesh. the black parts around have a fine texture on it. The top is soft rubber. The whole thing feels like a old radio (in a good way) with a modern touch. I personally like it better than the jawbone box or UE style, which is way too future-ish young-kids looking. SoundLink 3 is also pretty heavy. Won't be a good choice to carry around. All in all, very solid build.SoundLine Mini reminds me the Iphone. It is a whole piece of Aluminum, as least looks like it. Also heavy for its size. but much more portable.2. Sound quality:Low Volume: SoundLink3 sounds better than SoundLink2 hands down. When played at same low volume, soundLink3 is MUCH better than soundLink2 in my opinion. The sound is much more clear, vocal really stands out. the high pitch is better, but still not quite there. The mini actually sounds the best at low volume. SoundLink 3 has a \"deeper/wider/thicker\" sound than the mini, but some how the mini sounds more \"clear\" at low volume and my ear find it very pleasing.When I say low volume, I mean put it on my office desk. close the door and listen to it when working.High Volume: SoundLink 3 can get really loud. I can not bear how loud it gets when I crank it up. but I never liked loud music so keep that in mind.  For my life, I will never need that much noise. But you may want it. when turn the volume up, SoundLink 3 start to sounds better than the Mini. I am impressed it can go quite loud without much distortion. I am not saying mini is not loud. To me, Mini is good enough for my medium size room, I don't even need to turn it up that much for it starts to feel too loud. I don't know why I would ever need SoundLink 3's loud volume. Unless I want to throw a pool party.Base: The base on the Mini is just amazing. I still can not believe how such a small thing can pump out that much base. Very good. The main complain I have about UE boom box and Jawbone is they do have better high but the base is just lacking. But that again is a personal preference. My friend loves his UE box and complains every time when he hear my mini saying \"too much base no high.\" But I like the base a lot, the music is \"fuller\". My opinion, UE & Jawbone sounds tin-can-ish. I don't want that much high with no base. But again \"sound better\" is your feeling, so listen to them and make your own decision.SoundLink 3 has good base, too. also it can maintain a clear layer of sound with that base. the base is not as heavy flavored as the mini. At low volume, I think mini has a more noticeable base. At high volume, soundLink 3 start to catch up.Conclusion:1. If you like full base like me, go for Bose, if you likes high pitch better UE boom may be better. it is cheaper than Mini, and has a microphone you can make call, also has a cool app. I totally don't care about those. I want better sound for music.2. For bose, SoundLink 3 can get much louder than Mini and it sounds better at high volume. If you want loud music so your office mate next door can go complain to the boss, chose soundLink3. If you only need to fill a medium office/living room with clear music, go for mini.3. don't forget mini is 100 less than SoundLink 3. For me, if I can only keep one, I will keep the mini, it is good for all my needs. But I will keep both, I may start a party in the hall way, you never know.--Update--One more thing:Do you know that the Bluetooth devices you use to connect to those speaker make a difference? I used Samsung Note phone, Iphone, Ipad & Kindle HDX to test the same song on SoundLink3, they actually sounds different form each device. Which is very strange. Isn't this suppose to be digital? Anyway, They are obviously different to me. The best sound actually comes from my Kindle HDX, Ipad and Iphone are OK, Samsung note sounds the worst. So if you have more than one bluetooth device, try pair them all and find out if they really sound different or I am just crazy.



       "1681013  First, after my Dell arrived,  I got the keyboard/case ($29.98) to fix the problem of repeating characters on the Dell's virtual keyboard. Then I ordered this kit.  It includes a really good wireless Mouse, a powered X 3 USB multiplier, and an ever useful USB adapter.  They all work, and it's probably best to get them this way - all together.This kit is not only useful for my Dell Venue 8 Pro, I can also use the accessories with  my Surface RT  They are pretty standard, so they should work on other Tablets  just as well.  .

       "1681101  External batteries are a very important device for USB charged devices. Every year manufacturers create more advanced hardware and software while failing to create a more advanced battery; which leads to frustration because of the inefficient battery. Fortunately, Eachine has made the Eachine 3000mAh portable backup External battery Perfume power bank Charger as an external battery and flashlight for your USB charged devices.Inside the packaging is the flash light power bank, a 2-in-1 USB charger, a silk bag, and a user manual. I really like the simplistic design of the power bank, and the fact that it comes with a flash light. A lot of power banks this size don&#8217;t include a flashlight, so this is a great feature.This power bank includes a apple 30 pin connector (4th gen iPod and previous models) and a micro USB connector. The length of the cord is about 8-8.5 inches with a white design that is similar to all apple cords. The gauge of the wire is also comparable to iPod cords.The included bag is made of a silk material and measures 5 x 2 inches. It can fit the power bank inside it very nicely but has issues when the power bank and charger cord is included. Most power banks don&#8217;t include a bag, so this is a very nice feature to have included with the device.The power bank is fairly small and light (0.8 x 0.8 x 4.2 inches and 3 ounces). For the price of $14.99, this is the perfect present to anyone who needs the flashlight and power bank combo, and it also comes in four really stylish colors: red, black, silver, and gold. At the top face is the Eachine logo, a button which activates the flashlight, and an LED indicator (statuses below):When charging:Red LED = Device is chargingBlue LED = Device is fully chargedWhen On:Blue LED = Indicates device is on.I wish this device would include indicators other than the two LEDs. Many other devices would include at least four LEDs to indicate how charged this device is. At the bottom is a micro USB port to charge the device and a 5V 1A port to charge your USB device. I like that this is charged by micro USB, as this is a very common cord that can be bought at most convenient stores if it were ever lost, damaged, or stolen. At the top is the flash light that is activated from the button on the top face.I started by testing the time to charge the power banks (red, black, gold, silver). They all initially had the red LED and was able to successfully charge within 2.5 hours. These results are pretty good for a battery this size. I then tested the flashlight, and found that the light is very bright. I would definitely use this battery for the flash light alone. The button to activate the flashlight is very responsive, as I am able to turn the light and off immediately.I then tested this with my Nexus 7 (2013), running Android 4.2.2, with a 3950 mAh battery, and my iPod 4th generation, running iOS 6.1.6, with a 930 mAh battery. The connector for both the micro USB and apple 30 pin connector both aren&#8217;t great fits. The connectors both have trouble fitting in their counter parts, which is unfortunate since this cord would save a lot of space. I started by testing my Nexus 7 (2013) and found that my device is taking the following from the power bank:0.36A5.26V0.5 Peak A5.21 Min VThese are good results, as my Nexus 7 doesn&#8217;t take the entire 1A from the external battery. I then tested how long and efficient the battery was:Test 1:20% 6:45pm55% 7:44pm62% 7:56pm &#8211; Red power bank overheatedTest 2:1% 12:23am19% 1:22am20% 1:23am &#8211; Black power bank overheatedI was able to successfully charge my Nexus 7 (2013) 42% in 1 hour 11 minutes and 19% in 1 hour, but unfortunately the batteries over heated. This is disappointing that such a stylish looking power bank would experience such issues.I then tested this on the iPod 4th generation:0% 8:13pm - Gray100% 10:30pm - Blue light still and still charging930 mA h / 2.25 hours = 413 mA per hourI was able to charge the device from 0% to 100% in 2 hours 17 minutes. This is 413 mA an hour, which isn&#8217;t horrible for any device, but isn&#8217;t great either. I do want to note that this external battery does not have any automatic shut off when your device is fully charged, so please keep an eye on the charger while your device is being charged.I reviewed this product prior to the warnings that tablets weren&#8217;t recommended to be charged. As long as you heed these warnings, this is a quality battery that is definitely worth every penny, and is why I give this product 5 out of 5 stars.Pros:+ Price at 14.99 is the perfect price point to anyone who needs flash light and power bank combo.+ Portable and perfect for travel.+ Uses micro USB interface for charging, which is a very common cord that can be bought at any convenient store if it were lost, damaged, or stolen.+ Very simplistic and stylish design.+ Choice of four colors (Black, red, gold, silver)+ Includes micro USB and apple 30 pin connector in one cord.+ Includes a very bright LED flashlight for the dark.+ Includes a silk bag that is able to fit the power bank inside, but not able to fit connector and power bank.Cons:- Not able to charge tablets.- Has no automatic shut off when your device is fully charged.- Includes a silk bag that is able to fit the power bank inside, but not able to fit connector and power bank.- Only two LED indicators: Red for charging, blue for fully charged and on. Most other power banks would include at least 4 LEDs to indicate charge.- Fit of the micro USB and apple 30 pin connector isn&#8217;t great. They both have trouble fitting the connectors.I was supplied this sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.

       "1681183  On the 11-inch form factor, I've been a Chromebook user for almost 2 years now and my happy casual computing experience on a beautiful HP Chromebook 11 and on a Samsung Chromebook before that might have produced some Chromebook bias. To at least reduce it, because I want my reviews to be as bias-free as possible, I forced myself to use this Asus for at least one hour each day for the past several weeks. It wasn't easy and, after all these weeks, I am still a Chromebook user and, nothing personal, I will prefer a good 11\" Chromebook to a Windows 8 of the same size, touch-enabled or not, very much every time. I will explain why.PHYSICALI remember reading someone's remarks on how laptops are expected to 'travel around the world'. I do know a few world travelers but my experience is that most people do not travel around the world very often and my view is that the 11-inch form factor is meant to 'travel around the house' or fit into a backpack pocket and travel to school or to a friend's house. To that extent, each ounce counts because I want to be able to grab my little computer with one hand and move it around easily. When compared to my favorite HP Chromebook, the Asus machine feels heavy and significantly so. The Asus is also a lot thicker and it's a lot more difficult to open it, generally requiring two hands. The HP, on the other hand, is much thinner and feels light as a feather. It opens and closes easily and turns itself on once opened, with no need of more buttons pushing.I can see why, being heavier, the Asus benefits from a rougher, grooved skin because you need a better grip. However, the grooved finish is likely to make it harder to clean and I wasn't able to wipe out fingerprints with a microfiber cloth the way I do it on the HP.The Asus comes with its dedicated charger and it works well. Only the HP Chromebook, while charging faster through its own, can also use very much any phone/tablet charging device to at least keep in going and usually to slowly charge it in an emergency.PERFORMANCE AND SPECSThe Asus has better specs, on paper. The CPU is faster, has more memory, has its own hard disk and a large number of ports: 3 USBs, HDMI, card reader, VGA, Ethernet. But... wait... no Bluetooth, which probably explains the large number of physical ports. And the 802.11 Wi-Fi appears to be limited to 2.4GHz b/g/n and to not work in the 5GHz band. I prefer the HP Chromebook's elegant Bluetooth solution for connecting to various peripherals. Yes, it has fewer ports but, I must confess, except for sometimes using a USB dongle required by a mouse, I never felt a need for a physical port on it. Streamers such as Chromecast and Roku and various online services and 'the cloud' have very much eliminated the need for a physical HDMI port and I wouldn't want to see lots wires or any wires coming in and out of my little 11-inch gadget anyway.The Asus and the HP have similar screen resolutions supported but the Asus has 4GB of RAM, twice as much compared to the HP and it needs it because a computer needs a lot of RAM to support the ultra-heavy Windows 8 OS. Same for CPU speed. The Asus CPU is faster if we are to count cycles but it appears actually slower when in use due to the enormous Windows overhead.The built-in HDD, present in the Asus but not in a Chromebook, while of some (diminishing) utility, adds weight to the Asus machine and makes it run warmer that I prefer - I'm already used to the Chromebooks running silent and cool to notice even the low hum that the Asus HDD makes while churning through the Windows overhead 'stuff' and perhaps constantly checking for malware and file corruption.INTERFACEI actually love Windows 7. I also love the Chrome browser interface I get with Chrome OS. I can't stand Windows 8. It's bloated to the extreme, it's unnecessarily complicated and it appears to be more concerned with enabling Microsoft to suck in all the information it can from you, presumably to sell it to advertisers and who knows who else (ohh.. NSA, I forgot) and to promote its 'properties': Skype, Bing, Internet Explorer... I am not saying that Windows 8 can't be 'easy to use'. Yes, it can if you don't mind Microsoft telling you what's 'good for you' and doing exactly as told. If you want to deviate or customize a little... yes you can but, in my case, I ended up with a Chromebook-like interface, only a lot slower and harder to get to running on a hotter, heavier, noisier little computer.The Windows 8's inherent complexity gets even more annoying with this version's support for touch. It's 'neither here nor there'. The screen touch is poorly and unintuitively implemented in my view and my feeling was that I ended up with a dirty screen for no good reason. I believe 'touch' was an afterthought or a rush in Windows 8 and it shows. For example, when I click the touchpad on the login screen, a unneeded on-screen keyboard is displayed as if Windows doesn't know that it's running on a laptop with a permanently attached keyboard.WHY THIS ASUS?I am not sure if I wanted this as my everyday little laptop under any circumstance. Unless I felt that it was my duty to supply Microsoft and its business partners with loads of my personal data while sacrificing some convenience in the process. I use my 11-inch little computers for casual, in-house activities: watching movies in bed, reading the news while having breakfast, checking my emails, looking up things on Google or the Wikipedia, making quick phone calls, casting some Youtube videos to the big screen TV. All of the above are performed beautifully and easily by the lighter, thinner, cooler, easier to use, prettier and less expensive HP Chromebook. And I don't need to worry about viruses and constant and lengthy patches on it, disk crashes and file corruption or more bloatware stacking on top of pre-installed bloatware slowing everything down to a crawl. Yes, the Asus has a HDD and its sides are poked with various ports but I never felt the need of an HDD for my Chromebook and, the fewer ports that I almost never use the better. Yes, some laptops can and should be used for both 'home and office'. They tend to be significantly more powerful and can be used with add-ons such as 'docking stations' to allow for large screen, mice, full-size keyboards and other peripherals. This Asus should not be imagined as a home/office device.To conclude, this little computer is not 'for me'. I simply can't imagine myself connecting peripherals to a toy-like device made of home use through three (?), doing a wired Ethernet connection or attaching a thick HDMI cable to it. And I don't understand that lack of Bluetooth and its not supporting the 5GHz band for Wi-Fi when even $50 streamers do these days. My Chromebook bias and general dislike of Windows 8 noted, I simply don't like this machine. The ASUS has nice specs that maybe could be put to good use if Windows was replaced with some less bloated OS but, as is, I couldn't justify buying this machine. The \"don't like it\" should normally translate into a 2-star rating but I'm going to rate it as a 3-star, mostly because of the excellent display.

       "1681525  After going back and forth between the COSMOS 90GT WiFi and the NexStar 4SE for several weeks, I finally opted to go with the COSMOS 90GT for my first telescope.  I ended up choosing it for several reasons:1.  I liked the idea of the interface with my iPhone and iPad.  I had already been using the Celestron COSMOS Navigator App to just locate constellations and such, and I really liked the app.  The thought of using it to control the telescope was very appealing to me.2.  Call me a geek, but I kind of liked the COSMOS features on the telescope.  The light up SOTI, the COSMOS Eye Nebula, and the fact that it came with a Cosmic Calendar all tickled my fancy.3.  I live in a suburb of a small-medium city.  It's not too bright, but I do live close to a couple of facilities that have some fairly bright lights at night.  After looking around a bit and asking some questions, I found that refractors tend to be a little bit less affected by &#34;washing out&#34; from light pollution.4.  My main points of interest in the night sky were the planets.  Primarily Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn...along with the moon.  From my reading, the refractor telescope seems to be the best suited design for primarily viewing the planets.I ended up ordering the telescope after a few weeks of deliberation.When it arrived, I was initially impressed with the packaging.  The look and design of the box was really nice.  In fact, I plan on keeping the box to display in my hobby room, I was so impressed with how it looked.I set about opening the box and getting the telescope built.  In fact, I have a video of the unboxing, assembly, and first WiFi connection to the app.  I will try to get it uploaded along with this review.The telescope was easy to assemble.  I followed the instructions and had no problems whatsoever with putting it together.  A word of caution, when you are attaching the telescope mount to the tripod, don't tighten it as much as possible.  I did, and it was a real pain to get it loosened so that I could level the tripod when I went to use the telescope for the first time.  I've since learned not to tighten it as much as possible, just snug it up and then maybe another 1/8th of a turn and it'll be good to go.The only slight hiccup with the telescope for me was the finder scope.  I was able to get it aligned, however, it is at the extreme end of one of the adjustment screws.  Basically, it can't go any more in that direction.  I guess that doesn't matter, seeing as how it's aligned at about 1/2 mile very well, but I thought I'd mention it.  I wish it had just a bit more throw in that direction, because I'm a bit concerned that having it tightened down the way it is may cause it to eventually not hold.  With that said, I'll probably be replacing the finder with a right angle finder in the near future, simply for the ease of use.  When using the finder in the field for things that are up high in the sky, it can literally be a pain in the neck as you crank your body around to get to a point where you can see through the finder.After getting the telescope all built and the finder dialed in, it was time to see some stuff in the sky!!!Or...not.  Of course, the day I got the thing the sky was completely overcast all night.  I was then informed that when you order a new telescope, the UPS man usually brings at least three days of clouds with him.In short order, though, I was all set to get out and use the telescope.  On the day that I was planning to use it, I took it out to check the alignment of the finder scope one more time.  It was at this time that I had another self created problem.  When I was packing the telescope back up to take it home from where I was checking the alignment, I wrapped the cord around the battery holder too tight, and managed to pull one of the wires out of the crimp connector.  It was nothing a quick hit with a soldering iron couldn't fix, but do note that you shouldn't wrap that cord around the thing tight, because you might end up pulling a wire out!After getting that sorted, it was time to take it out to the field.  I have a few vacant lots behind my house, so I just took it out there and set it up.Connecting to the telescopes WiFi couldn't be any easier.  It's just like connecting to a home or work WiFi system, and once you've connected once you should automatically connect if there's no stronger WiFi signal in range.This was when I ran into my second self created problem.  It had gotten fairly dark, and I had absolutely no clue which items in the sky were considered &#34;bright&#34; objects.  See, to use the alignment system on the telescope for it's automatic GoTo function to work, you must align the telescope to three bright objects.I tried first using the moon, and then two bright objects...at least they appeared to be bright to me...about 120 degrees away from the moon on either side.  I understood that using objects farther apart and in different parts of the sky works best for this.Alignment failed.I then tried using the moon and a star closer to it, then one on the other side of the sky.Alignment failed.I then tried skipping the moon and picking three stars on different sides of the sky.Alignment failed.Finally, I tried aligning it to two stars on one side of the sky that seemed the brightest, then one on the other side that was lower in the sky near some known light pollution.  My thought process was that if this star could be seen through the light pollution, it must be bright.Success!!  The system told me that it was aligned, told me what I had used to align the telescope, and then I was able to use it.I found that my alignment must have been off by just a few degrees, because as the telescope went to things, it was always off by the same amount.  Not so much that I couldn't see an object, but enough that a few clicks of fine tuning were needed to get the object completely centered.After checking around, I found the following tips for alignment.1.  Make 100% sure the telescope's tripod is level.  If it isn't level, then the telescope won't know exactly what you're looking at when you get objects centered, and the way it does it's calculations for alignment will effectively be confused.  I have found that using a level with the telescope mount not on the tripod works very well for getting the telescope completely level.2..Do your alignment when it's just starting to get to twilight.  Those first few stars that show up in the sky are the brightest, so if you use those you'll be getting three KNOWN bright objects.3.  Get objects centered in the 25mm eyepiece, then switch down to the 10mm eyepiece and make sure they are centered in that one, too.  There's a good chance that what you think is centered in the 25mm eyepiece is really a bit off.  I found when switching down to the 10mm eyepiece, I was always off a few degrees with my centering.  After getting the object centered in the 10mm eyepiece, &#34;unfocus&#34; the star a bit to make it a big fuzzy ball.  When you do this, you will more easily be able to see how close to the center of the eyepiece you are.4.  If you are trying to use the moon, you need to be very careful that you're actually centering on it.  The moon moves fairly quickly, so getting it centered can be tough.By following these suggestions, I've been able to get the telescope to align quickly and accurately on the first try when I use it.Anyways, back to the use of the telescope...Once you've got it aligned, I have found that the tracking and GoTo features work very well.  Even if the alignment is just a hair off, you'll always find what you're looking for.  I've been able to leave the telescope just sitting for about 20 minutes, then go back to it and the item I was looking at will still be right in the same spot on the eyepiece as it was when I left the telescope.Keep in mind, if you want to track the moon you must use the app to select a different tracking method, as the default is to track the stars.I wanted to take a moment to mention that the first time I was using the telescope, I accidentally pulled Saturn into view when trying to align the telescope.  I was in a rush to try to get the alignment done, so I didn't spend a ton of time looking at it...but once I had alignment done, it was the first thing I went back to.Seeing that planet was a very strange feeling.  It was mesmerizing, almost zen like.  It was easy to pick out the sphere of the planet itself and the separation of it's rings.  Switching to the 10mm eyepiece just made it more amazing.  I just looked at the planet for the better part of 20 minutes.  I was completely in awe.  For that little bit of time, it seemed like there wasn't anything in the universe but me and that object a billion kilometers away.  THIS was exactly the reason that I wanted a telescope...to lose myself in the stars and planets of the night sky.So far, I'm really loving the telescope.  It works well, provides great views of the things I've been looking at, and comes fairly fully featured.  I would suggest picking up a 2x barlow for some better magnification, but even without that you can still get stunning views of the moon, Saturn, Mars, and other objects in the sky.  So far for me, Jupiter hasn't been able to be seen...it hides behind the tree line that's west of my home.The tripod isn't the greatest, but it's also not as terrible as some reviews would have you believe.  Make sure when you get it you tighten all of the hardware.  Loose hardware leads to unsteady legs on the tripod.  When you need to adjust the focus, you will have to give the telescope a few seconds to &#34;settle down&#34; from the vibrations, but I think that's fair considering the tripod came in a kit that costs less than a lot of tripods alone cost.  I have found that if you suspend some weight from the center of the tripod, you can give the telescope a much more &#34;planted&#34; feel.  Experiment with that to see if it helps with your tripod's sturdiness.  This is an old photographers trick that effectively &#34;loads&#34; the tripod and forces it to be more sturdy due to the way the legs are now working.  Trust me, it works.There are a couple of things I'd like to see updated into the app itself.  I'm honestly hoping that this new way of connecting a GoTo telescope to a controller via applications on tablets will yield quicker updates, fixes, and additions.First, I would like to see some more alignment options.  It's my understanding that with other NexStar telescopes you can do a two star alignment as long as a few other things are in order.  I'd like that to be added.  I'd also like the system to be able to align if I point it at KNOWN stars and tell it what I'm looking at.  For example, I'm quickly learning the names of some of the things in the sky.  I'd love to be able to get Mars in my eyepiece, then tell the system I'm looking at Mars.  Then move to Antares, and tell the system I'm looking at Antares.  Once it knows that those two things are what they are, I think it should be able to align.Next, I'd like the app to run a bit smoother.  It runs very smoothly all the time...except...when the telescope is actually slewing to an object.  If you try to get it to do anything while the telescope is moving, it gets very slow to respond.  I've found that quitting all of my other running apps minimizes this, but it's still something I think might be able to be worked out of the system.Finally, the app tends to send the telescope in a direction that doesn't make any sense sometimes.  For instance, if I'm looking at the moon and want to switch to Saturn, even though Saturn is about 90 degrees to the left of where I'm seeing the moon, from time to time the system will send the telescope the other direction...so it must now move 270 degrees to get to where I want it to be.  I'm not sure if this is done on purpose for some reason that I can't think of, or if it's simply a strange glitch in the software.  Either way, having it take the quickest and most direct route to the object you've selected would help preserve battery life, and it would also take a bit less time.These things all seem like items that can be worked out of the system with an update, and I hope that will be the case.For everything that I've looked at, and the fun I've had, though, this telescope fully deserves the five star rating.I look forward to using it, and to getting some accessories to better my enjoyment of it.   \n",
       "1681699  I've only had these batteries about 2 months. They've gone through about a half dozen recharge cycles each. One of them is already bulging and I can barely get the battery door shut on the camera when that battery is installed.The price is right and they hold a lot of power but the quality is apparently not up to snuff. I'll revisit this review later to see how much life I get out of the other battery.Edit: After a few days the swelling battery above was bulging so bad it was no longer usable. However, shortly after I posted this review I was contacted by the seller (Blue Nook) and was sent out not one but two replacement batteries (in the event that my other battery goes south). Great customer service and this should give any potential buyers the confidence to purchase this product from this seller because they are willing to go out of their way to make things right if you have any problems with the product.

       "1681711  Upon receiving the package, I immediately started to charge both batteries in the dual charger. However, I noticed that the charger became untouchably hot, then it soon burned out.I then contacted Terry at Blue Nook's customer service department and he was extremely helpful in remedying my issue. He suggested it was a faulty charger and sent out a new charger at no extra cost to me. I received the new charger in a timely manner and it works great now.Thanks Terry and Blue Nook!

       "1682172  This is a simple way of playing music from a bluetooth enabled  device on a stereo or sound system.Set up was simple. I plugged the receiver into my stereo with a cable that came with this. I then plugged the power adapter to a nearby outlet. I was then able to play music from my tablet on my stereo. The one thing people need to do before buying this is make sure that the cable that comes with this (and RCA to 3.5mm audio cable) can connect to their stereo or sound system. As of now the cable is shown on this Amazon page and the a link to the owner&#8217;s manual also exists.I had no problem pairing this with my tablet.  It only took a few minutes.The sound quality is good. It sounds like what I would expect from my stereo.If you are looking for a way to get better sound quality from a blue tooth enabled device this is a good way to go.

       "1682590  Got this as a gift for my brother who had a Samsung 8 inch Tablet - and loved it. This tablet is a 10.1 inch quad core with stereo speakers. He loves the bright screen and not having to always plug in his ear buds to watch a video - sound is great. Can check his email quickly without using up battery on phone or turning on his laptop. Can't beat the price.

       "1682608  I bought it primarily to use as a tablet and I think I just bought the wrong one. The 500 gb hdd and the 3.0 usb port are in the (keyboard) dock which is useless to you if you are trying to use it as a tablet.  Of the 32 gb available on the tablet there are only 29 available to begin with (where do those other 3 go anyway) and all but 12 of them are used up with all the programs/apps I assume because that is all that is availabe on mine.  I am returning it and have ordered the 64 gb with a 64 gb micro sd card which will hopefully be a better fit for me and then if I need memory in the dock I will just plug in my external hard drive that I use on my laptop which I assume will work on the 64 gb since it works on the 32/500 gb.  I am looking forward to getting the 64 gb and expect that my review will go to a five star because it appears to me that this thing would have been perfect for my needs if it had just had more memory.  I am not a &#34;techy&#34; but I suspect that the problems that i have seen discussed in other reviews are probably memory related in that these little machines were asked to do more than they have the ability to do.

       "1682616  First of all, in ordef to compare, I had before this a Samsung 12.5 inch core i5 notebook, and an Asus Memopad Smart 10 with 16gb (with a 64gb microsd card) + I'm an average tech user, love technology but I won't/can't buy a Sony Vaio Pro 11 or a Apple Macbook Air 11.About this Asus, I was about to buy the 64gb model and then... PLUFF! Just went online for buying the one with the 500gb HDD inside the keyboard (yes, it's true, 500gb!). And... I didn't doubt it... if you are gonna get a tablet with a detachable keyboard and full WINDOWS 8.1 (yes... not an RT Windows; this one comes with a FULL WINDOWS 8.1 32 bits + full Office with original license) you should (must) get the one with de 500gb of HDD).Well, one by one :BATTERY - Wonderful !!!For me, one of the most important things about the item that I was looking for.For example: got it this last saturday, april 12th. I start using the tablet saturday night for about 2 hours with the original charge from factory (turned it on at 100%). Cup of configurations, WiFi, the essencial. Turned it off with 97%.Then Sunday: started again at 11 am next day. Copying from my external 500gb HDD to the keyboard (it has a blue 3.0 USB port) about 250/300gb of several files during day (video, images, exe, etc). Mostly with the keyboard connected. Lot of config. Checking Youtube videos, surfing the web, installing Avast, reading news, etc. Of course, closing the tablet sometimes for lunch, taking a nap ;-), going to the market .... and... went full offline at 11 pm!!Can't say anything but great things about the battery life.SCREENFor my eyes, I must say that it seems to have a beautiful, bright and clear image. I was watching youtube videos (HD quality), some 720p movies downloaded from Yify... all great.The touch: very accurate; you can do all the moves that you used to do with your mouse, right button menu, etc. Also you have the Asus gesture.. you can config what to do with your fingertouch.KEYBOARDBrutal... cool! Just great. Inside you will find a 500gb HDD. Also.. and important: when you are in the Windows 8 screen (with the icons) for example, if you want, you can install the VLC player from the MICROSOFT MARKET. Then (don't know much about this) I downloades and installed the full version of the VLC player (from the VLC website from Chrome). And this is the important: you can install everything you want directly on your 500gb HDD, without problem. Another example: just installed the Corel 12 on the 500gb HDD and runs perfect! (another tip there you have: the COREL 12 works wonderfull with this processor).Oh.. also.. it's very confortable the type. Yes.. separated keys, good mousepad.Release the keyboard: just press the middle buttom and take away the tablet. Recommendation: go to the USB disconnect and safe option, as any other USB pendrive.HDMIDidn't get my HDMI cable! Just didn't come on the box. But, had another from an old cell (the Motorola XT860) and will test it soon.WEIGHTSeparatly, the tablet it's very light.. as any other similar 10 inch tablet. And.. sure.. the battery lasts more (be aware: the keyboard does not have it own battery and only one USB 3.0 port). But together (plus keyboard) it's pretty good. A woman could take it on her purse and woundn't bother.MICRO SDSupports up to 64gb microsd card (had one). Could be protected perhaps, but well, just insert it by the right side and done!CAMERAFront camera, OK for Skype. And agreed: not having rare camera it's not good!BATTERY CHARGEDon't know about other users, but when I went off because the battery was empty,1) just plugged in to the wall and went online (no waiting at all).2) at midnight, 00.00 o'clock left charging (turned off) and this morning at 7.50 am was fully charged.OTG (on the go) CABLEAs any other tablet, when I was using the KEYBOARD USB 3.0 with my external HDD, I plugged the mouse to the tablet using an OTG cable (USB female one side and MICRO USB on the other side) and done!Well.. I think that you will finde very helpful this review because I wrote all the things that I was searching for before buying some tablet/netbook. I'am an Android S.O fun.. I have a Samsung S3 (soon the S4 or S5) and I don't regret the fact of not having a tablet with Android S.O. because all software that I use day by day on a full NOTEBOOK won't find it on Android apps.I mean, yes.. you have the VLC.. but the Corel? The old windows desk friend? Like the Android on my cell, want the Windows 8.1 full on my computer (Windows 7 would be better! hehehe).have fun, go for it!!

       "1682622  Little dude is durable, fast, and does hold fingerprints on the outside.Get the 500gb HDD in the keyboard if you plan on using it as a replacement laptop/tablet.Webcam is so-so but really that's any built in camera. Haven't had any wifi issues yet.Win8.1 is something else, really. Not better or worse than Win7, maybe a little worse.This is lightweight and the only downside is that it is so small it won't fit in a normal old laptop bag because of its size.

       "1682646  Save your money and skip this. It really doesn't work well and does not use the docking power pins on a Nexus 7. It is really just a USB connector with a fancy stand. Not worth the money.It is quite a shame that Google has not properly accessorized its Nexus line of tablets (either directly or requiring its OEMs to make accessories available). One of the big advantages of an iPad is the range of Apple and 3rd party accessories that increase its usefulness. Google completely fails to recognize that, which is a shame since Android itself is quite adaptable.

       "0  I loved my Kindle Fire my son bought me for Christmas.  Well, it died on me so this one is a replacement.  Everything is fine except one of the games I noticed didn't hold anything.  My grandson plays Subway Surfer and he worked for months to get the guys and prices by collecting all the boxes and points.  Well, this new one didn't save it so he lost all of it.  He was heart broken.  he is only 7 yrs old with some issues and it broke my heart that this game wasn't saved for him.  I would of thought that since they had all the other stuff they could keep the progress on the games too.Besides for that it is great.  It took a while to remember the setup and all but eventually I got it.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Especially for young ones.                                                    \n",
       "1  Kindle has come up with a new Kindle Fire HDX... Mine is  the older version now. But the &#34;new Kindle Fire HD 7'' has no cam.. I dont get it. the newer Kindle Fire HDX is like the old Kindle Fire... It gets confusing. I read the specs and the new Kindle Fire HDX has improved features but why downgrade the new Kindle Fire HD to a Kindle Fire... so you can justify the higher cost for Kindle Fire HDX 7'' ?Anyway I say I would have given my now older Kindle Fire HD a 5/5 but since the new Kindle Fire HD (without a cam) came out I  give  it maybe a 3 or 4 star. I have 6 registered Kindle Fire HD (with front cam) and now they are older generation... i will have to wait and see next few weeks / months if i will  have problems now that the newer version of Kindle Fire HD (without cam) is out soon.   \n",
